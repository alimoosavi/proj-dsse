"18887823","Is it possible to decrypt SHA1","<p>Is it possible to decrypt(retain the actual string) the password which is saved in db using <code>SHA1</code> algorithm.</p>

<p>Example:If password is <code>""password""</code> and it is stored in db as <code>""sha1$4fb4c$2bc693f8a86e2d87f757c382a32e3d50fc945b24""</code>,is any chance to retain the same <code>""password""(string)</code> from <code>""sha1$4fb4c$2bc693f8a86e2d87f757c382a32e3d50fc945b24""</code> </p>
","<p>SHA1 is a one way hash. So you can not really revert it.</p>

<p>That's why applications use it to store the hash of the password and not the password itself.</p>

<p>Like every hash function SHA-1 maps a large input set (the keys) to a smaller target set (the hash values). Thus collisions can occur. This means that two values of the input set map to the same hash value.</p>

<p>Obviously the collision probability increases when the target set is getting smaller. But vice versa this also means that the collision probability decreases when the target set is getting larger and SHA-1's target set is 160 bit.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Preshing</strong>, wrote a very good blog about <a href=""http://preshing.com/20110504/hash-collision-probabilities/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hash Collision Probabilities</a> that can help you to decide which hash algorithm to use. Thanks Jeff.</p>

<p>In his blog he shows a table that tells us the probability of collisions for a given input set.</p>

<p><a href=""http://preshing.com/20110504/hash-collision-probabilities/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ldEA.png"" alt=""Hash Collision Probabilities Table""></a></p>

<p>As you can see the probability of a  32-bit hash is 1 in 2 if you have 77163 input values.</p>

<p>A simple java program will show us what his table shows:</p>

<pre><code>public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] inputValue = new char[10];

        Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; hashValues = new HashMap&lt;Integer, String&gt;();

        int collisionCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 77163; i++) {
            String asString = nextValue(inputValue);
            int hashCode = asString.hashCode();
            String collisionString = hashValues.put(hashCode, asString);
            if (collisionString != null) {
                collisionCount++;
                System.out.println(""Collision: "" + asString + "" &lt;-&gt; "" + collisionString);
            }
        }

        System.out.println(""Collision count: "" + collisionCount);
    }

    private static String nextValue(char[] inputValue) {
        nextValue(inputValue, 0);

        int endIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; inputValue.length; i++) {
            if (inputValue[i] == 0) {
                endIndex = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        return new String(inputValue, 0, endIndex);
    }

    private static void nextValue(char[] inputValue, int index) {
        boolean increaseNextIndex = inputValue[index] == 'z';

        if (inputValue[index] == 0 || increaseNextIndex) {
            inputValue[index] = 'A';
        } else {
            inputValue[index] += 1;
        }

        if (increaseNextIndex) {
            nextValue(inputValue, index + 1);
        }

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>My output end with:</p>

<pre><code>Collision: RvV &lt;-&gt; SWV
Collision: SvV &lt;-&gt; TWV
Collision: TvV &lt;-&gt; UWV
Collision: UvV &lt;-&gt; VWV
Collision: VvV &lt;-&gt; WWV
Collision: WvV &lt;-&gt; XWV
Collision count: 35135
</code></pre>

<p>It produced 35135 collsions and that's the nearly the half of 77163. And if I ran the program with 30084 input values the collision count is 13606. This is not exactly 1 in 10, but it is only a probability and the example program is not perfect, because it only uses the ascii chars between <code>A</code> and <code>z</code>.</p>

<p>Let's take the last reported collision and check </p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(""VvV"".hashCode());
System.out.println(""WWV"".hashCode());
</code></pre>

<p>My output is</p>

<pre><code>86390
86390
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>If you have a SHA-1 value and you want to get the input value back you can try a brute force attack. This means that you have to generate all possible input values, hash them and compare them with the SHA-1 you have. But that will consume a lot of time and computing power. Some people created so called <strong>rainbow tables</strong> for some input sets. But these do only exist for some small input sets.</p>

<p>And remember that many input values map to a single target hash value. So even if you would know all mappings (which is impossible, because the input set is unbounded) you still can't say which input value it was.</p>

","<p><code>SHA1</code> is a cryptographic hash function, so the intention of the design was to avoid what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>However, breaking a <code>SHA1</code> hash is technically possible. You can do so by just trying to guess what was hashed. This brute-force approach is of course not efficient, but that's pretty much the only way.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: yes, it is possible, but you need significant computing power. Some researchers estimate that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#The_SHAppening"" rel=""noreferrer"">it costs $70k - $120k</a>.</p>

<p>As far as we can tell today, there is also no other way but to guess the hashed input. This is because operations such as <code>mod</code> eliminate information from your input. Suppose you calculate <code>mod 5</code> and you get <code>0</code>. What was the input? Was it <code>0</code>, <code>5</code> or <code>500</code>? You see, you can't really 'go back' in this case.</p>

<p>It seems that breaking a single hash would cost about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Attacks"" rel=""noreferrer"">2.7 million dollars</a> worth of computer time currently, so your efforts are probably better spent somewhere else.</p>

","<p>The usual answer goes thus: what is the probability that a rogue asteroid crashes on Earth within the next second, obliterating civilization-as-we-know-it, and killing off a few billion people? It can be argued that any unlucky event with a probability lower than that is not actually very important.</p>

<p>If we have a ""perfect"" hash function with output size <em>n</em>, and we have <em>p</em> messages to hash (individual message length is not important), then probability of collision is about <em>p<sup>2</sup>/2<sup>n+1</sup></em> (this is an approximation which is valid for ""small"" <em>p</em>, i.e. substantially smaller than <em>2<sup>n/2</sup></em>). For instance, with SHA-256 (<em>n=256</em>) and one billion messages (<em>p=10<sup>9</sup></em>) then the probability is about <em>4.3*10<sup>-60</sup></em>.</p>

<p>A mass-murderer space rock happens about once every 30 million years on average. This leads to a probability of such an event occurring in the next second to about <em>10<sup>-15</sup></em>. That's <strong>45</strong> orders of magnitude more probable than the SHA-256 collision. Briefly stated, if you find SHA-256 collisions scary then your priorities are wrong.</p>

<p>In a security setup, where an attacker gets to choose the messages which will be hashed, then the attacker may use substantially more than a billion messages; however, you will find that the attacker's success probability will still be vanishingly small. That's the whole point of using a hash function with a 256-bit output: so that risks of collision can be neglected.</p>

<p>Of course, all of the above assumes that SHA-256 is a ""perfect"" hash function, which is far from being proven. Still, SHA-256 seems quite robust.</p>

","<p>I'm not aware of a way to override the default md5 encryption of passwords, but if you have a ROLE (aka ""USER"") that has an already md5-encrypted password it appears that you can supply that. Verify this using pg_dumpall -g (to see the globals from the cluster)

create role foo with encrypted password foobar;

-- create the role again with the already-encrypted password

","<p>You may provide the password already hashed with <code>md5</code>, as said in the doc (<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-createrole.html"">CREATE ROLE</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ENCRYPTED UNENCRYPTED These key words control whether the password is
  stored encrypted in the system catalogs. (If neither is specified, the
  default behavior is determined by the configuration parameter
  password_encryption.) <strong>If the presented password string is already in
  MD5-encrypted format, then it is stored encrypted as-is</strong>, regardless of
  whether ENCRYPTED or UNENCRYPTED is specified (since the system cannot
  decrypt the specified encrypted password string). This allows
  reloading of encrypted passwords during dump/restore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The information that's missing here is that the MD5-encrypted string should be the password concatened with the username, plus <code>md5</code> at the beginning.</p>

<p>So for example to create <code>u0</code> with the password <code>foobar</code>, knowing that <code>md5('foobaru0')</code> is <code>ac4bbe016b808c3c0b816981f240dcae</code>:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE USER u0 PASSWORD 'md5ac4bbe016b808c3c0b816981f240dcae';
</code></pre>

<p>and then u0 will be able to log in by typing <code>foobar</code> as the password.</p>

","<p>Samir's answer is correct but somewhat cryptic. Basically, the salt is just a randomly derived bit of data that you prefix or postfix your data with to dramatically increase the complexity of a dictionary attack on your hashed value. So given a salt <code>s</code> and data <code>d</code> you'd just do the following to generate a salted hash of the data:</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib
hashlib.sha512( s + d ).hexdigest()

","<p>If you're looking for a replacement for crypt(), newer versions of glibc have SHA-512-based ""$6$"" with a variable iteration count (see <a href=""http://people.redhat.com/drepper/sha-crypt.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ulrich Drepper's page</a>, which has a description and links to a complete C implementation of <code>sha512_crypt_r()</code>).</p>

<p>Writing your own crypto is highly unadvisable — the above <code>sha512(salt+password)</code> doesn't help against a brute-force attack.</p>

<p>For generating salt, use something like <code>os.urandom(16)</code> for random bytes or <code>''.join(map(lambda x:'./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[ord(x)%64], os.urandom(16)))</code> for random base64-alike chars (for use with crypt()-alikes).</p>

","<p>SHA512 isn't a great way to store hashed passwords these days.  You should be using bcrypt or something similar.  What's important is that salting is built in and that the algorithm has a significant work factor.</p>

<p>If you salt your SHA512 passwords by simply appending (or prepending) the salt to the plaintext, anyone who gets their hands on a set of your hashed passwords and applies a modern cracking tool (<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/</a>) will be able to see the concatenated password+salt values and will probably, through trivial pattern matching, be able to separate the password portion from the salt portion for most if not all of the accounts in question.</p>

<p>I haven't thought this through all the way, and I am by no means a security expert, but it seems to me that if you were to encrypt (using, for example, AES256) the password using the salt as the key, and then hash <em>that</em> with SHA512, you'd be safe from the vulnerability I described above.</p>

<p>However, at that point you've put in more effort than it would have taken to switch to bcrypt and you still wouldn't have the protection of a work factor, so I would only recommend an approach like that if the environment you're working in does not offer that option.</p>

","<p>The PHP function <code>bin2hex</code> means that it takes a string of bytes and encodes it as a hexadecimal number.</p>

<p>In the Java code, you are trying to take a bunch of random bytes and decode them as a string using your platform's default character encoding. That isn't going to work, and if it did, it wouldn't produce the same results.</p>

<p>Here's a quick-and-dirty binary-to-hex conversion for Java:</p>

<pre><code>static String bin2hex(byte[] data) {

<p>Let's say I want to uniquely identify this change: <a href=""https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/e62999f9ece7d9218b9768a908f8df9c11d7e920"">https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/e62999f9ece7d9218b9768a908f8df9c11d7e920</a></p>

<p>But I feel like that would be risky.  But ssuming a codebase that, over a couple of years, might have—say—30k changes, what are the chances of collision if I use 8 characters?  12?  Is there a number that's generally considered acceptable for this sort of thing?</p>
","<p>This question is actually answered in <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#Short-SHA-1"">Chapter 7 of the Pro Git book</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique
  within a project. One of the largest Git projects, the Linux kernel,
  is beginning to need 12 characters out of the possible 40 to stay
  unique.</p>

<p>7 digits is the Git default for a short SHA, so that's fine for most projects. The Kernel team have increased theirs several times, as mentioned, because the have <em>several hundred thousand</em> commits. So for your ~30k commits, 8 or 10 digits should be perfectly fine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default of 7 comes from fairly early in git development, when seven hex digits was a lot (it covers about 250+ million hash values).<br>
  Back then I thought that 65k revisions was a lot (it was what we were about to hit in BK), and each revision tends to be about 5-10 new objects or so, so a million objects was a big number.</p>

<p>(BK = BitKeeper)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These days, the kernel isn't even the largest git project, and even the kernel has about 220k revisions (<em>much</em> bigger than the BK tree ever was) and we are approaching two million objects.<br>
  At that point, seven hex digits is still unique for a lot of them, but when we're talking about just two orders of magnitude difference between number of objects and the hash size, there <em>will</em> be collisions in truncated hash values.<br>
  It's no longer even close to unrealistic - it happens all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fairly early days we somehow decided to abbreviate object names down to 7-hexdigits, but as projects grow, it is becoming more and more likely to see such a short object names made in earlier days and recorded in the log messages no longer unique.</p>
  
  <p>Currently the Linux kernel project needs 11 to 12 hexdigits, while Git itself needs 10 hexdigits to uniquely identify the objects they have, while many smaller projects may still be fine with the original 7-hexdigit default.  One-size does not fit all projects.</p>
  
  <p>Introduce a mechanism, where we estimate the number of objects in the repository upon the first request to abbreviate an object name with the default setting and come up with a sane default for the repository.  Based on the expectation that we would see collision in a repository with <code>2^(2N)</code> objects when using object names shortened to first N bits, use sufficient number of hexdigits to cover the number of objects in the repository.<br>
  Each hexdigit (4-bits) we add to the shortened name allows us to have four times (2-bits) as many objects in the repository.</p>

","<p>This question has been answered, but for anyone looking for the math behind - it's called <em>Birthday problem</em> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>It is about the probability of having 2 (or more) people from group of N people to have birthday on the same day in year. Which is analogical to probabily of 2 (or more) git commits from repository having N commits in total having the same hash prefix of length X.</p>

<p>Look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Probability_table"" rel=""noreferrer"">Probability table</a>. For example for hash hex string of length 8 the probability of having a collision reaches 1 % when the repository has just about 9300 items (git commits). For 110 000 commits the probability is 75 %. But if you have hash hex string of length 12 the probability of collision in 100 000 commits is below 0.1 %.</p>

","<p>Finally I get the answer and it works well. As described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5147789/nosuchmethoderror-using-commonc-codec-in-android-application"">No such method error in Apache codec</a> for another type of encrypt (Base64) I tried to reproduce the same issue and I get exactly the same error. So I was in the case of the question attached. As they say, it seems to be an internal name collision with the package name <code>org.apache.commons.codec</code> and as stated by @Don I changed it to <code>com.apache.commons.codec</code> and worked fine! How I did it?</p>

<p>I downloaded the source code and changed the 3 directories <code>org</code> to <code>com</code>. I also replaced all the occurrences of the package name in the files where they appear and also changed the references in the docs to <code>com/apache/commons/codec/</code>. (Do not try to remane them manually or you will spend the hole day). Then I compiled the library and generated the jar with Ant, which I called <code>commons-codec-1.6-android.jar</code>. I put the jar in the <code>libs/</code> folder of my Android app and added it to the buildpath. Also, I attached the sources as the folder which contains all the files. So now I have the library ready to use with Android!</p>

<p>Hope that it helps someone else!</p>

","<p>I ran into the same issue trying to use DigestUtils in my Android app. This was the best answer I could find by searching, but I was reluctant to rebuild the .jar file with the namespace changed. After spending some time on this issue, I found an easier way to solve the problem for my case. The problem statement for my code was </p>

<pre><code>String s = DigestUtils.md5Hex(data);
</code></pre>

<p>Replace this statement with the following and it will work:</p>

<pre><code>String s = new String(Hex.encodeHex(DigestUtils.md5(data)));
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, for shaHex exampl, you can change it to</p>

<pre><code>String hash = new String(Hex.encodeHex(DigestUtils.sha(""textToHash"")));
</code></pre>

<p>This works because even though Android does not have encodeHexString(), it does have encodeHex(). Hope this would help others who run into the same issue.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>As this is a very active question, I've changed the accepted answer in favour of @DA25, as his solution is straightforward and the high number of upvotes prove that it works.</p>
","<p>Since there's no clear answer for the root cause of this problem, I'd like to clarify what's happening here.</p>

<p><strong>Why the NoSuchMethodError is thrown in the first place?</strong></p>

<p>According to exception stack trace, the line that causes the fault is 226 in <code>DigestUtils#md5hex</code> method. Let's see what we have <a href=""https://github.com/apache/commons-codec/blob/CODEC_1_4/src/java/org/apache/commons/codec/digest/DigestUtils.java#L218-227"">there</a> (I'm assuming you have used version 1.4, since this is the only release where <code>Hex#encodeHexString</code> method is being invoked in line 226):</p>

<pre><code>public static String md5Hex(String data) {
    return Hex.encodeHexString(md5(data));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The exception says <code>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex.encodeHexString</code>.
Let's understand why.  </p>

<p>First of all, Android framework already includes the <code>Commons Codec</code> library (except the <code>DigestUtils</code> class). Yes, it is not exposed as part of the <code>Android SDK</code> and you cannot use it directly. But you still want to use it. So what you do? You add <code>Commons Codec</code> library as part of your application. The compiler doesn't complain - from his point of view everything was fine.</p>

<p>But what happens at runtime? Let's follow your exception stack trace:<br>
First, you're calling <code>DigestUtils#md5Hex</code> from your Activity's <code>onCreate</code> method. As I wrote above, the framework doesn't include that class, so <code>DigestUtils</code> (from <code>Commons Codec</code> version 1.4) is loaded from your dex.<br>
Next, <code>md5hex</code> method tries to invoke <code>Hex#encodeHexString</code> method. <code>Hex</code> class is part of the <code>Commons Codec</code> library that included in framework. The thing is that its version is <strong><em>1.3</em></strong> (ancient release from July 2004). <code>Hex</code> class exists in boot classpath, which means that the runtime will always favor it instead of the <code>Hex</code> class that packaged inside your dex. You can see warnings about it in your application logs when you start your app (with Dalvik runtime):  </p>

<pre><code>D/dalvikvm? DexOpt: 'Lorg/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex;' has an earlier definition; blocking out
I/dalvikvm? DexOpt: not resolving ambiguous class 'Lorg/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex;'
D/dalvikvm? DexOpt: not verifying/optimizing 'Lorg/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex;': multiple definitions
I/dalvikvm? Could not find method org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex.encodeHexString, referenced from method org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.md5Hex
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Hex.html#encodeHexString(byte[])"">Hex#encodeHexString</a> method was introduced in version 1.4 of <code>Commons Codec</code> library and therefore it doesn't exist in framework's <code>Hex</code> class. The runtime can't find this method and thus throws <code>NoSuchMethodError</code> exception.</p>

<p><strong>Why the accepted answer's solution works?</strong></p>

<pre><code>String s = new String(Hex.encodeHex(DigestUtils.md5(data)));
</code></pre>

<p>First, <code>DigestUtils#md5</code> method is called. As I already stated, <code>DigestUtils</code> class that will be used is the one that packaged in your dex. This method doesn't use any other <code>Commons Codec</code> classes, so no problem with it.  </p>

<p>Next, <code>Hex#encodeHex</code> will be called. The <code>Hex</code> class that will be used is the framework's one (version 1.3). The <code>encodeHex</code> method (that takes a single parameter - byte array) exists in version 1.3 of <code>Commons Codec</code> library, and therefore this code will work fine.</p>

<p><strong>What would I suggest?</strong></p>

<p>My suggested solution is to rename the classes namespace/package. By doing so I'm explicitly specifying which code is going to execute, and prevent bizarre behavior that may occur because of versioning issues.  </p>

<p>You can do it manually (as Caumons wrote in his answer), or automatically with <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/jarjar/"">jarjar</a> tool.  </p>

<p>See this issue summary and tips for using <code>jarjar</code> in my <a href=""http://blog.osom.info/2015/04/commons-codec-on-android.html"">blogpost</a>.</p>

<p>I have executed the same code in a Java class outside Android and it works! So, I do not know why when working with Android it does not work...

<p>The line of code which causes the exception is:</p>

<p><code>String hash = DigestUtils.shaHex(""textToHash"");</code></p>

<p>I have executed the same code in a Java class outside Android and it works! So, I do not know why when working with Android it does not work... I put the libraty inside a new libs/ folder in my app and updated the BuildPath to use it. If I try to use md5 instead of sha1 I get the same exception. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>As this is a very active question, I've changed the accepted answer in favour of @DA25, as his solution is straightforward and the high number of upvotes prove that it works.</p>
","<p>Another way to rename <code>DigestUtils</code> class will be with proguard.
If you are not using proguard you can enable it and add this one line which will obfuscate only <code>DigestUtils</code> class, and leave everything else intact.</p>

<pre><code>-keep class !org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils,com.** { *; }
</code></pre>

<p>and add this to your app <code>build.gradle</code></p>

<pre><code>buildTypes {
        debug {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Or <strong>OPTION 2</strong>
Use old version of the library in your code:</p>

<pre><code>implementation(""commons-codec:commons-codec:1.3""){
        force = true
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Need to use <code>force = true</code> if <code>common-codec</code> dependency come from third part library otherwise Gradle will resolve by default to higher version.</p>

","<p>Use SHA-2. Always. SHA-1 shall be reserved to situations where SHA-2 cannot be used due to interoperability issues with legacy code.</p>

<p>There is no performance issue until actual measures have been performed. Hash functions are fast. In most situations, hash function performance has only negligible impact; even detecting it could prove difficult. Security comes first. Since weaknesses have been found in SHA-1, using it nonetheless requires some robust justification. Using SHA-256 will not be questioned; this is the ""default choice"". But if you use SHA-1, prepare to be criticized.</p>

<p>Note that there are <em>four</em> functions known as ""SHA-2"": SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. SHA-224 and SHA-256 are the same function, save for an internal parameter (the ""initial value"") and the output size (SHA-224 output size is 28 bytes, whereas SHA-256 offers 32 bytes); they have the same performance characteristics. Similarly, SHA-384 and SHA-512 are the same function performance-wise. SHA-512 uses 64-bit arithmetic operations and is faster than SHA-256 on platforms which offer 64-bit opcodes; on 32-bit platforms, SHA-256 will be faster (note: on 32-bit x86 with native code, it is possible to use the SSE2 opcodes and their 64-bit computing abilities, hence <em>some</em> native code implementations of SHA-512 will be faster than SHA-256 in 32-bit mode; the OpenSSL code does that; but, as far as I know, the SHA-512 implementation in .NET is ""managed code""). Also, all the SHA-* functions have some basic granularity, because they process data by chunks: for SHA-256, chunks are 64-byte long, whereas SHA-512 uses 128-byte chunks; when hashing very short data elements, the higher SHA-512 granularity correspondingly lowers its performance. Finally, SHA-256 (on a 32-bit platform) is likely to yield smaller code (i.e. use less L1 cache on the CPU).</p>

<p>So, when in doubt, use SHA-256. If you plan on using SHA-1 then you should doubt.</p>

<p>If you want to use a hash function for a non-cryptographic usage (i.e. the weaknesses are not a problem for you) then, instead of SHA-1, consider <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1320"" rel=""noreferrer"">MD4</a>.</p>

","<p>SHA is a digest algorithm, not an encryption algorithm. Digest values are not decryptable. That's why they are secure. Two different inputs may give same digest values. But it is a very little possibility. For sha256 it is 1/(2^256).</p>

The <code>NoSuchAlgorithmException</code> indicates that a requested algorithm could not be found and is necessary because the method takes a <code>String</code> argument for the algorithm name. If you passed in ""foo-256"", the method's only recourse is to throw a <code>NoSuchAlgorithmException</code> because, for reasons beyond my understanding, there's no algorithm called ""foo-256"". Assuming you're passing in a name you're sure is an algorithm that Android can use, you'll never see that exception.</p>

<p>I'm getting this error.</p>

<pre><code>Error   1   error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _MD5_Init referenced in function _main

<p>So my question is, I have downloaded the latest release (openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz), what should I config in VS2012 to be able to use the lib? Thanks!</p>

<p>The steps required to use the openSSL lib with VS2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>download and install a version (I have 64bit OS, however I installed 32bit openssl) from <a href=""http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html</a>. </li>
<li>New project in VS, then Configuration Properties/C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories: openssl include folder (C:\OpenSSL-Win32\include)</li>
<li>Linker/General/Additional Library Directiories: C:\OpenSSL-Win32\lib</li>
<li>Linker/Input/Additional Dependencies :</li>
</ul>

  libeay32MD.lib ssleay32.lib ssleay32MTd.lib ssleay32MT.lib
  ssleay32MDd.lib ssleay32MD.lib</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(It was written that I need to only add that one which matches with C/C++/Code Generation/Runtime Library, but It works me this way.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy theese files into current VS folder /VC/lib</li>
</ul>
","<p>What compiler did you use to compile OpenSSL? Did you use MinGW? If so, make sure you don't strip them (or just with --strip-unneeded) otherwise import symbols will be stripped. Do the header and lib version match?</p>

<p><strong>Recommended approach</strong></p>

<p>If you are using Spring Security 3.1, the recommended approach would be to go for bcrypt, this automatically generates a salt and concatenates it.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;beans:bean id='bCryptPasswordEncoder' class='org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder'/&gt;

&lt;authentication-manager&gt;
  &lt;authentication-provider user-service-ref=""userDetailsService""&gt;
          &lt;password-encoder ref=""bCryptPasswordEncoder""/&gt;
  &lt;/authentication-provider&gt;
&lt;/authentication-manager&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can generate the user password like this:</p>

<pre><code>String password = ""p4ssword"";
PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
String encodedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode(password);

","<p>The principle behind salting hashes is that you are not vulnerable to rainbow tables. If you use static salt then its possible (but expensive) for someone to build a rainbow table for <em>your</em> salt. If the pickings are sweet, someone will do it.</p>

<p>Ideally your salt should be random (eg use bytes from a <code>SecureRandom</code>) and should be different for each user. You should store the salt alongside the hashed password, eg if you are using a database table then simply have a salt column.</p>

<p>The latest versions of Spring Security (3.1 and later) try to handle salt in an automatic, transparent manner. The password encoder will automatically generate random salt and append it to the hash instead of storing it separately (eg in different columns). Because hashes and the salt have a fixed length it is easy to determine which part of the data is which.</p>

<p>As mentioned in other answers, <strong>you still have to follow the rules</strong>. This works in only the very narrow case where you have the exact same branch, parents, and committer (such as with a code-review-centric process where you have a bunch of commits queued up somewhere, where the developers can push them up and bring them down without necessarily submitting them into the repository first); really only when the timestamps are the only thing that might have changed. In this case, you can force the identical revision in order to force the timestamps to be unchanged. </p>

<p>In most other cases, the parent will usually be different, and, this alone, means that your dream of forcing a certain revision will be dead. Git will always fix-up the revision to be correct if any of the non-timestamp factors are different.</p>

","<p>Essentially the same, but maybe more elegant than adding extra fields: In the default authentication framwork in <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Django</a>, the password hashes are stored as strings constructed like this:</p>

<pre><code>hashtype$salt$hash
</code></pre>

<p>Hashtype is either sha1 or md5, salt is a random string used to salt the raw password and at last comes the hash itself. Example value:</p>

","<p>Bouncy Castle doesn't support XML formats at all. Unless your use-case strictly requires it, you'll find it much easier going just to use Base64 encodings, with certificates (X.509) and private keys (PKCS#8) stored in PEM format. These are all string formats, so should be usable with JSON directly.</p>

<p>There are other problems in the code samples: signing should use the private key, signatures shouldn't be treated as ASCII strings, possibly your messages are actually UTF8. I would expect the inner sign/verify routines to perhaps look like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public string SignData(string msg, ECPrivateKeyParameters privKey)
    {
        try
        {
            byte[] msgBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg);

            ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
            signer.Init(true, privKey);
            signer.BlockUpdate(msgBytes, 0, msgBytes.Length);
            byte[] sigBytes = signer.GenerateSignature();

            return Convert.ToBase64String(sigBytes);
        }
        catch (Exception exc)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Signing Failed: "" + exc.ToString());
            return null;
        }
    }

    public bool VerifySignature(ECPublicKeyParameters pubKey, string signature, string msg)
    {
        try
        {
            byte[] msgBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg);
            byte[] sigBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(signature);

            ISigner signer = SignerUtilities.GetSigner(""SHA-256withECDSA"");
            signer.Init(false, pubKey);
            signer.BlockUpdate(msgBytes, 0, msgBytes.Length);
            return signer.VerifySignature(sigBytes);
        }
        catch (Exception exc)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Verification failed with the error: "" + exc.ToString());

<p>A further issue is that I think .NET didn't get ECDSA support until .NET 3.5, in any case there's no ECDsa class in .NET 1.1 (which is BC's target for the upcoming 1.8 release - we will be ""modernising"" after that), so DotNetUtilities doesn't have support for ECDSA. However, we can export to PKCS#12 and import to BC. An example program:</p>

<pre><code>    public void Program()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Attempting to load cert..."");
        System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 thisCert = LoadCertificate();

        Console.WriteLine(thisCert.IssuerName.Name);
        Console.WriteLine(""Signing the text - Mary had a nuclear bomb"");

        byte[] pkcs12Bytes = thisCert.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12, ""dummy"");
        Pkcs12Store pkcs12 = new Pkcs12StoreBuilder().Build();
        pkcs12.Load(new MemoryStream(pkcs12Bytes, false), ""dummy"".ToCharArray());

        ECPrivateKeyParameters privKey = null;
        foreach (string alias in pkcs12.Aliases)
        {
            if (pkcs12.IsKeyEntry(alias))
            {
                privKey = (ECPrivateKeyParameters)pkcs12.GetKey(alias).Key;
                break;
            }
        }

        string signature = SignData(""Mary had a nuclear bomb"", privKey);

        Console.WriteLine(""Signature: "" + signature);

        Console.WriteLine(""Verifying Signature"");

        var bcCert = DotNetUtilities.FromX509Certificate(thisCert);
        if (VerifySignature((ECPublicKeyParameters)bcCert.GetPublicKey(), signature, ""Mary had a nuclear bomb.""))

        else
            Console.WriteLine(""Signature NOT valid!"");
    }

<p>I haven't really tested any of the above code, but it should give you something to go on. Note that BC has key and certificate generators too, so you could choose to use BC for everything (except XML!), and export/import to/from .NET land only where necessary. </p>

key <code>xBy/2CLudnBJOxOtDhDRnsDYq9HTuDVr2uCs3FMzoxXEA/Od9tOuwSC70+mIfpjeG68ZGm/PrxFf/s/CzwxF4Q==</code>
creates output of <code>/UhwvT/kY9HxiXaOjpIc/BarBkc=</code>.</p>

<p>Given that data and key, I cannot get this same result in Java.  I have tried several online calculators, and none of them return this result either.  Is the example in their documentation incorrect, or am I just not handling these strings correctly?</p>

<p>Here is the code I am currently working with:</p>

<pre><code>public static String calcShaHash (String data, String key) {
    String HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM = ""HmacSHA1"";       
    String result = null;

    try {         
        Key signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);
        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);
        mac.init(signingKey);
        byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes());
        result = Base64.encodeBase64String(rawHmac);    
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace(); 
    }       

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my unit test code:</p>

<pre><code>@Test

    String result = Utils.calcShaHash(data, key);
    assertEquals(result, ""/UhwvT/kY9HxiXaOjpIc/BarBkc="");

}

<p>You can try for yourself by running SHA against all one-byte inputs, then against all two-byte inputs and so on, and see if you get a collision. Probably not, because no one has ever found a collision for SHA-256 or SHA-512 (or at least they <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Comparison_of_SHA_functions"" rel=""nofollow"">kept it a secret from Wikipedia</a>)</p>

","<p>A hash function accepts inputs of arbitrary (or at least very high) length, and produces a fixed-length output. There are more possible inputs than possible outputs, so collisions must exist. The whole point of a secure hash function is that it is ""collision resistant"", which means that while collisions must mathematically exist, it is very very hard to actually compute one. Thus, there is no known collision for SHA-256 and SHA-512, and the best known methods for computing one (by doing it <em>on purpose</em>) are so ludicrously expensive that they will not be applied soon (the whole US federal budget for a century would buy only a ridiculously small part of the task).</p>

<p>So, if it cannot be realistically done <em>on purpose</em>, you can expect not to hit a collision out of (bad) luck.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you limit yourself to very short inputs, there is a chance that there is no collision <em>at all</em>. E.g., if you consider 12-byte inputs: there are 2<sup>96</sup> possible sequences of 12 bytes. That's huge (more than can be enumerated with today's technology). Yet, SHA-256 will map each input to a 256-bit value, i.e. values in a much wider space (of size 2<sup>256</sup>). We cannot prove it formally, but chances are that all those 2<sup>96</sup> hash values are distinct from each other. Note that this has no practical consequence: there is no measurable difference between not finding a collision because there is none, and not finding a collision because it is extremely improbable to hit one.</p>

<p>Just to illustrate how low risks of collision are with SHA-256: consider your risks of being mauled by a gorilla escaped from a local zoo or private owner. Unlikely? Yes, but it still may conceivably happen: it seems that a gorilla escaped from the <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4558461/ns/us_news/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dallas zoo in 2004</a> and injured four persons; another gorilla escaped from the <a href=""http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/02/14/Escaped-gorilla-recaptured-at-Dallas-Zoo/UPI-15751266174950/"" rel=""noreferrer"">same zoo in 2010</a>. Assuming that there is only one rampaging gorilla every 6 years on the whole Earth (not only in the Dallas area) and you happen to be the unlucky chap who is on his path, out of a human population of 6.5 billions, then risks of grievous-bodily-harm-by-gorilla can be estimated at about 1 in 2<sup>43.7</sup> per day. Now, take 10 <em>thousands</em> of PC and have them work on finding a collision for SHA-256. The chances of hitting a collision are close to 1 in 2<sup>75</sup> per day -- more than a <em>billion</em> less probable than the angry ape thing. The conclusion is that if you fear SHA-256 collisions but do not keep with you a loaded shotgun at all times, then you are getting your priorities wrong. Also, do not mess with Texas.</p>

","<p>There is no minimum input size. SHA-256 algorithm is effectively a random mapping and collision probability doesn't depend on input length. Even a 1 bit input is 'safe'.</p>

<p>Note that the input is padded to a multiple of 512 bits (64 bytes) for SHA-256 (multiple of 1024 for SHA-512). Taking a 12 byte input (as Thomas used in his example), when using SHA-256, there are 2^96 possible sequences of length 64 bytes.</p>

<p>As an example, a 12 byte input <em>Hello There!</em> (0x48656c6c6f20546865726521) will be padded with a one bit, followed by 351 zero bits followed by the 64 bit representation of the length of the input in bits which is 0x0000000000000060 to form a 512 bit padded message. This 512 bit message is used as the input for computing the hash.</p>

","<p>Your best bet would be the truncating well-known hash function (MD5 or SHA-family) because these algorithms have statistically good uniform distributions of the hash values (and also using full hash and not just 6 chars there).</p>

<p>Now some calculations for probability of collision</p>

<pre>
- Number of letters in English alphabet: 26
- Add capitals: 26
- Add numerics: 10
--------------

In total you get 26 + 26 + 10 = 62 characters. 

Now you have 6 places, which gives you 62^6 possible combinations.
That is 56.800.235.584 ~ 57 billion combinations. 
This is a space of possible hash values - N.
--------------
To compute collisions let's use the formula 

Pcollision = K^2 / 2N

Which is a very rough approximation of collision probability

</pre>

<p>Now let's see the result table for a number of items in a table - K</p>

<pre>
# items     | Probability of collision
---------------------------------------
10          |  1.7 * 10^-9
100         |  1.7 * 10^-7
1K          |  1.7 * 10^-5
10K         |  1.7 * 10^-3
100K        |  0.17
</pre>

<p>This formula can only be used for small K, but it shows that given 100K entries in the hash table you would roughly have 17% chance of collision.</p>

","<p>The best solution is almost certainly to use SHA1, convert to Base62 (although Base64 would be much easier as it's built in to the framework <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dhx0d524.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Convert.ToBase64String</a>.

","<p>If you build OpenSSL by running the <code>config</code> or <code>Configure</code> script, you provide <code>no-&lt;cipher&gt;</code> as an argument to exclude the cipher.  Run <code>Configure</code> with no options to see the available build options.</p>

<p>The configuration script converts these arguments into options for the preprocessor.  Here's a list of nearly everything you can disable at compile time.  First is the configuration-script argument, and then the compiler argument it gets converted to.</p>

<p>Note that some things have dependencies.  For example, you cannot build the SSL library without ciphers and digest algorithms because the SSL and TLS protocols demand them.  So instead of doing <code>make all</code>, you want to do <code>make build_crypto</code> so that it only builds libcrypto.a.</p>

<p>Through experimentation, I found (in OpenSSL 0.9.8r) that libcrypto has 2 algorithm dependencies:  MD5 for the random-number generator's algorithm (in crypto/rand_lib.c) and SHA-1 for printing certificate hashes (in crypto/asn1/t_x509.c).  I'd say these dependencies are oversights by the developers.</p>

<p>This is how I build libcrypto.a with only MD5 and SHA:</p>

<pre><code>./config no-idea no-aes no-camellia no-seed no-bf no-cast no-des no-rc2 no-rc4 no-rc5 \
no-md2 no-md4 no-ripemd no-mdc2 no-rsa no-dsa no-dh no-ec no-ecdsa no-ecdh no-sock \
no-ssl2 no-ssl3 no-err no-krb5 no-engine no-hw
make depend
make build_crypto

<p>So that's my code, however, I have not been able to make that SHA512 and I have already tried <code>public static final String algorithm = ""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512""</code> but that doesn't seem to be the right string for the algorithm since it throws the no such algorithm exception.</p>

<p>I also welcome any changes that would make the code better.</p>

<p>What you have to do is derive the <code>PBKDF2HmacSHA1Factory</code> (come on, it is <strong>open</strong>!) and add a parameter to its constructor. You may avoid the mess of creating your own <code>Provider</code>, and just initialize and use your factory as follows:</p>

<pre><code>PBKDF_SecretKeyFactory kf = new PBKDF_SecretKeyFactory(""HmacSHA512"");
KeySpec ks = new PBEKeySpec(password,salt,iterations,bitlen);

<li>Call a HMAC256 routine to compute the hash value. The hash value must also be treated as a binary value (unsigned char in C language, byte in Java). The hmac size is 32 bytes.</li>
<li>Convert the hmac binary values to uppercase hexadecimal printable characters (for example, a onebyte binary value of 0000 1010 has a hexadecimal value of 0x0A and will be translated to the twobyte characters “0A”).</li>

What will be the identification of my certicate <strong>SHA1/SHA2</strong>?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>TL;TR: signature and thumbprint are totally different things. For strength of the certificate thumbprint is irrelevant but signature is relevant.</p>

<p>The signature of a certificate is the thing the issuer creates by signing the certificate. This signature is used by the TLS stack (inside the browser) to validate the trust chain. It is important to use a strong algorithm here so that nobody can create a fake certificate which looks like it was signed by a trusted issuer (CA). </p>

<p>The thumbprint is just a hash over the certificate. It is mainly intended for human reception, i.e. check that the certificate is the intended one. This is usually used with self-signed certificates where the browser can not validate the certificate by itself since there is no trusted issuer and so the user should verify the certificate manually against the expected one. </p>

<p>A certificate has only a single signature since it has only a single issuer. But you often find multiple thumbprints for the certificate, i.e. one with MD5, one with SHA-1 and one with SHA-256. This is because the browser does not know which one you got for manual verification and that's why it offers you the most common versions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will be the identification of my certicate SHA1/SHA2?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The identification is the certificate itself, i.e. neither the signature not the thumbprint. But if you mean the ""this certificate was signed with ...."" part than this is SHA-256 in your case since what counts is the signature and not some thumbprint.</p>

","<p>You should watch out for creating weaknesses when combining methods. (The java hash function and your own). I did a little research on cascaded ciphers, and this is an example of it. (the addition might interfere with the internals of hashCode().</p>

<p>The internals of hashCode() look like this:</p>

<pre><code>        for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
            h = 31*h + val[off++];
        }

<p>so adding numbers together will cause the last characters of all strings in the array to just be added, which doesn't lower the randomness (this is already bad enough for a hash function).</p>

<p>If you want real pseudorandomness, take a look at the <a href=""http://isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FNV</a> hash algorithm. It is the fastest hash algorithm out there that is especially designed for use in HashMaps.</p>

<p>It goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>    long hash = 0xCBF29CE484222325L;
    for(String s : strings)
    {
        hash ^= s.hashCode();
        hash *= 0x100000001B3L;
    }

<p>I first tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64

&gt;&gt;&gt; w = base64.encodestring(q)

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>based on <code>plockc</code> answer I did this, and it seems to work:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES # encryption library

BLOCK_SIZE = 32

# the character used for padding--with a block cipher such as AES, the value
# you encrypt must be a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE in length.  This character is
# used to ensure that your value is always a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE
PADDING = '{'

# one-liner to sufficiently pad the text to be encrypted
pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING

# one-liners to encrypt/encode and decrypt/decode a string
# encrypt with AES, encode with base64
EncodeAES = lambda c, s: base64.b64encode(c.encrypt(pad(s)))
DecodeAES = lambda c, e: c.decrypt(base64.b64decode(e)).rstrip(PADDING)

# create a cipher object using the random secret
cipher = AES.new('aaaaaaaaaa123456')

# encode a string
encoded = EncodeAES(cipher, 'ABC123')
print 'Encrypted string: %s' % encoded

# decode the encoded string
decoded = DecodeAES(cipher, encoded)
print 'Decrypted string: %s' % decoded
</code></pre>
","<p>You probably need to elaborate on how you are going to use it and why, as you have just opened Pandora's box :)</p>

<p>An encoding is reversible and should only be used to make data fit into something else (like base 64 binary data when you can only use text), a hash (like sha224) is not supposed to be reversible.</p>

<p>If you want to verify a user entering a password, you hash it (with like sha224) and store the hash, then when the user enters password again, you hash their entry and compare.  This is the simplified version, you also need to add ""salt"" to avoid a simple ""dictionary attack"".  I won't elaborate as that wasn't the question you asked.</p>

<p>To quickly answer your question you want an encryption library, like the cipher AES-128, which has a secret key and with the key you can recover the original data.  There will be some details in the library on how to create the key (it has to be a specific length and will be manipulated to make it that length).  If your key is based on simple passwords, go look at PBKDF2, which makes a strong encryption key from a weak password.</p>

<p>Don't confuse hmac as encryption (hmac uses another function, like the hashing function sha224), if the receiver of a messages shares a hmac key with the sender, they can ""authenticate"" that the message can from the sender, and it came without alteration.</p>

","<p>It depends on how valuable the contents of the messages are.  The SHA family is demonstrably more secure than MD5 (where ""more secure"" means ""harder to fake""), but if your messages are twitter updates, then you probably don't care. </p>

<p>If those messages are the IPC layer of a distributed system that handles financial transactions, then maybe you care more.</p>

<p>Update: I should add, also, that the two digest algorithms are essentially interchangeable in many ways, so how much more trouble would it really be to use the more secure one?</p>

","<p>There is nothing insecure about using MD5 in this manner. MD5 was only broken in the sense that, there are algorithms that, given a bunch of data A additional data B can be generated to create a desired hash. Meaning, if someone knows the hash of a password, they could produce a string that will result with that hash. Though, these generated strings are usually very long so if you limit passwords to 20 or 30 characters you're still probably safe.</p>

<p>The main reason to use SHA1 over MD5 is that MD5 functions are being phased out. For example the Silverlight .Net library does not include the MD5 cryptography provider.</p>

<p>Apologies for repeated editing - I wasn't being clear with what I was asking.</p>
","<p>Yes, it is worth worrying about in practice. MD5 is so badly broken that <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/"" rel=""noreferrer"">researchers</a> have been able to forge fake certificates that matched a real certificate signed by a certificate authority. This meant that they were able to create their own fake certificate authority, and thus could impersonate any bank or business they felt like with browsers completely trusting them.</p>

<p>Now, this took them a lot of time and effort using a cluster of PlayStation 3s, and several weeks to find an appropriate collision. But once broken, a hash algorithm only gets worse, never better. If you care at all about security, it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm, such as one of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions"" rel=""noreferrer"">SHA-2 family</a> (SHA-1 has also been weakened, though not broken as badly as MD5 is).</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: The technique used in the link that I provided you involved being able to choose two arbitrary message prefixes and a common suffix, from which it could generate for each prefix a block of data that could be inserted between that prefix and the common suffix, to produce a message with the same MD5 sum as the message constructed from the other prefix. I cannot think of a way in which this particular vulnerability could be exploited in the situation you describe, and in general, using a secure has for <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104"" rel=""noreferrer"">message authentication</a> is more resistant to attack than using it for digital signatures, but I can think of a few vulnerabilities you need to watch out for, which are mostly independent of the hash you choose.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As described, your algorithm involves storing the password in plain text on the server. This means that you are vulnerable to any information disclosure attacks that may be able to discover passwords on the server. You may think that if an attacker can access your database then the game is up, but your users would probably prefer if even if your server is compromised, that their passwords not be. Because of the proliferation of passwords online, many users use the same or similar passwords across services. Furthermore, information disclosure attacks may be possible even in cases when code execution or privilege escalation attacks are not.</p>

<p>You can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hashed with a random salt; you store the pair <code>&lt;salt,hash(password+salt)&gt;</code> on the server, and send the salt to the client so that it can compute <code>hash(password+salt)</code> to use in place of the password in the protocol you mention. This does not protect you from the next attack, however.</p></li>
<li><p>If an attacker can sniff a message sent from the client, he can do an offline dictionary attack against the client's password. Most users have passwords with fairly low entropy, and a good dictionary of a few hundred thousand existing passwords plus some time randomly permuting them could make finding a password given the information an attacker has from sniffing a message pretty easy.</p></li>
<li><p>The technique you propose does not authenticate the server. I don't know if this is a web app that you are talking about, but if it is, then someone who can perform a DNS hijack attack, or DHCP hijacking on an unsecure wireless network, or anything of the sort, can just do a man-in-the-middle attack in which they collect passwords in clear text from your clients.</p></li>
<li><p>While the current attack against MD5 may not work against the protocol you describe, MD5 has been severely compromised, and a hash will only ever get weaker, never stronger. Do you want to bet that you will find out about new attacks that could be used against you and will have time to upgrade hash algorithms before your attackers have a chance to exploit it? It would probably be easier to start with something that is currently stronger than MD5, to reduce your chances of having to deal with MD5 being broken further.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, if you're just doing this to make sure no one forges a message from another user on a forum or something, then sure, it's unlikely that anyone will put the time and effort in to break the protocol that you described. If someone really wanted to impersonate someone else, they could probably just create a new user name that has a 0 in place of a O or something even more similar using Unicode, and not even bother with trying to forge message and break hash algorithms.</p>

<p>If this is being used for something where the security really matters, then don't invent your own authentication system. Just use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"" rel=""noreferrer"">TLS/SSL</a>. One of the fundamental rules of cryptography is <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-9904.html#different"" rel=""noreferrer"">not to invent your own</a>. And then even for the case of the forum where it probably doesn't matter all that much, won't it be easier to just use something that's proven off the shelf than rolling your own?</p>

","<p>Yes, someone can send a message and a correct hash without knowing the shared password.  They just need to find a string that hashes to the same value.</p>

<p>How common is that? In 2007, a group from the Netherlands announced that they had predicted the winner of the 2008 U.S. Presidential election in a file with the MD5 hash value <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/Nostradamus/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3D515DEAD7AA16560ABA3E9DF05CBC80</a>. They then created twelve files, all identical except for the candidate's name and an arbitrary number of spaces following, that hashed to that value. The MD5 hash value is worthless as a checksum, because too many different files give the same result.</p>

<p>This is the same scenario as yours, if I'm reading you right. Just replace ""candidate's name"" with ""secret password"". If you really want to be secure, you should probably use a different hash function.</p>

","<p>In this particular case, I don't think that the weakest link your application is using md5 rather than sha. The manner in which md5 is ""broken"" is that given that md5(K) = V, it is possible to generate K' such that md5(K') = V, because the output-space is limited (not because there are any tricks to reduce the search space). However, K' is not necessarily K. This means that if you know md5(M+T+P) = V, you can generate P' such that md5(M+T+P') = V, this giving a valid entry. However, in this case the message still remains the same, and P hasn't been compromised. If the attacker tries to forge message M', with a T' timestamp, then it is highly unlikely that md5(M'+T'+P') = md5(M'+T'+P) unless P' = P. In which case, they would have brute-forced the password. If they have brute-forced the password, then that means that it doesn't matter if you used sha or md5, since checking if md5(M+T+P) = V is equivalent to checking if sha(M+T+P) = V. (except that sha might take constant time longer to calculate, that doesn't affect the complexity of the brute-force on P).</p>

<p>However, given the choice, you really ought to just go ahead and use sha. There is no sense in not using it, unless there is a serious drawback to using it.</p>

<p>A second thing is you probably shouldn't store the user's password in your database in plain-text. What you should store is a hash of the password, and then use that. In your example, the hash would be of: md5(message + time + md5(password)), and you could safely store md5(password) in your database. However, an attacker stealing your database (through something like SQL injection) would still be able to forge messages. I don't see any way around this.</p>

","<p>Brian's answer covers the issues, but I do think it needs to be explained a little less verbosely</p>

<p><strong>You are using the wrong crypto algorithm here</strong> </p>

<p>MD5 is wrong here, Sha1 is wrong to use here Sha2xx is wrong to use and Skein is wrong to use. </p>

<p>What you should be using is something <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like RSA</a>.</p>

<p>Let me explain: </p>

<h3>
Your secure hash is effectively sending the password out for the world to see. 
</h3>

<p>You mention that your hash is ""time + payload + password"", if a third party gets a copy of your payload and knows the time. It can find the password (using a brute force or dictionary attack). So, its almost as if you are sending the password in clear text. </p>

<p>Instead of this you should look at a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">public key cryptography</a> have your server send out public keys to your agents and have the agents encrypt the data with the public key. </p>

<p>No man in the middle will be able to tell whats in the messages, and no one will be able to forge the messages.</p>

<p>On a side note, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/800685/which-hash-function-should-i-choose/817121#817121"">MD5 is plenty strong</a> most of the time. </p>

","<p>I'm not going to comment on the MD5/SHA1/etc. issue, so perhaps you'll consider this answer moot, but something that amuses me very slightly is whenever the use of MD5 et al. for hashing passwords in databases comes up.</p>

<p>If someone's poking around in your database, then they might very well want to look at your password hashes, but it's just as likely they're going to want to steal personal information or any other data you may have lying around in other tables. Frankly, in that situation, you've got bigger fish to fry.</p>

<p>I'm not saying ignore the issue, and like I said, this doesn't really have much bearing on whether or not you should use MD5, SHA1 or whatever to hash your passwords, but I do get tickled slightly pink every time I read someone getting a bit too upset about plain text passwords in a database.</p>

","<p>Yes, it is worth to worry about which hash to use in this case. Let's look at the attack model first. An attacker might not only try to generate values md5(M+T+P), but might also try to find the password P. In particular, if the attacker can collect tupels of values M<sub>i</sub>, T<sub>i</sub>, and the corresponding md5(M<sub>i</sub>, T<sub>i</sub>, P) then he/she might try to find P. This problem hasn't been studied as extensively for hash functions as finding collisions. My approach to this problem would be to try the same types of attacks that are used against block ciphers: e.g. differential attacks. And since MD5 already highly susceptible to differential attacks, I can certainly imagine that such an attack could be successful here. </p>

<p>Hence I do recommend that you use a stronger hash function than MD5 here. I also recommend that you use HMAC instead of just md5(M+T+P), because HMAC has been designed for the situation that you describe and has accordingly been analyzed.</p>

As such, I need to construct a hash in Android, that given the same inputs in ASP.NET will generate an equivalent hash. I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the Android code:</p>

<pre><code>public String computeHash(String input) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException{
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    digest.reset();
    try{
      digest.update(input.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e){
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

    byte[] byteData = digest.digest(input.getBytes());
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; byteData.length; i++){
      sb.append(Integer.toString((byteData[i] &amp; 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1));
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>AND HERE's THE CODE ON THE SERVER (c#):</p>

<pre><code>    private static string ComputeHash(string input, HashAlgorithm algorithm)
    {

        Byte[] inputBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);
        Byte[] hashedBytes = algorithm.ComputeHash(inputBytes);

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; hashedBytes.Length; i++)
        {
            sb.Append(String.Format(""{0:x2}"", hashedBytes[i]));
        }

        return sb.ToString();
    }

","<p>Google developed and uses (I think) FarmHash for performance-critical hashing. From the <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/farmhash/"" rel=""nofollow"">project page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FarmHash is a successor to CityHash, and includes many of the same tricks and techniques, several of them taken from Austin Appleby’s MurmurHash.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>On CPUs with all the necessary machine instructions, about six different hash functions can contribute to FarmHash's lineup. In some cases we've made significant performance gains over CityHash by using newer instructions that are now commonly available. However, we've also squeezed out some more speed in other ways, so the vast majority of programs using CityHash should gain at least a bit when switching to FarmHash.</p>

","<p><strong>The facts:</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li>Good hash functions, specially the cryptographic ones (like SHA-1),
require considerable CPU time because they have to honor a number of
properties that wont be very useful for you in this case;</li>
<li>Any hash function will give you only one certainty: if the hash values of two files are different, the files are surely different. If, however, their hash values are equal, chances are that the files are also equal, but the only way to tell for sure if this ""equality"" is not just a hash collision, is to fall back to a binary comparison of the two files.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The conclusion:</strong><br>
In your case I would try a much faster algorithm like CRC32, that has pretty much all the properties you need, and would be capable of handling more than 99.9% of the cases and only resorting to a slower comparison method (like binary comparison) to rule out the false positives. Being a lot faster in the great majority of comparisons would probably compensate for not having an ""awesome"" uniformity (possibly generating a few more collisions).</p>

<p>64 bits can also prove good enough if the number of files or chunks you want to track remain ""small enough"" (i.e. no more than a few millions ones).</p>

","<p>Since the only relevant property of hash algorithms in your case is the collision probability, you should estimate it and choose the fastest algorithm which fulfills your requirements.</p>

<p>If we suppose your algorithm has absolute uniformity, the probability of a hash collision among <em>n</em> files using hashes with <em>d</em> possible values will be:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/keOL0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For example, if you need a collision probability lower than one in a million among one million of files, you will need to have more than 5*10^17 distinct hash values, which means your hashes need to have at least 59 bits. Let's round to 64 to account for possibly bad uniformity.</p>

<p>So I'd say any decent 64-bit hash should be sufficient for you. Longer hashes will further reduce collision probability, at a price of heavier computation and increased hash storage volume. Shorter caches like CRC32 will require you to write some explicit collision handling code.</p>

","<p>Hashing functions are different than normal crypto algorithms. They are oftenly referred to as one-way ciphers, because the process data goes through is irreversible.</p>

<p>Differently than symmetric and assymetric encryption, hashes are used by asserting the hashed values themselves, instead of decrypting and asserting the plain-text values. To validate logins when you're using hashes, you'd hash the password the user just attempted to log in with and compare it with the hash you have on your DB. If they match, login is successful.</p>

<p>Cracking hashes involves guessing hashing various different strings and trying to match hashed values to the ones illegally obtained from a DB. There are lists available on the internet with millions of already hashed values to make hash cracking easier, those are known as <em>Rainbow Tables</em> and they can be easily countered with the use of <em>Salts</em>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that since hashing algorithms are able to digest GBs of data into significantly smaller strings, mathematically, two different values may have identical hashes. Even though this is very rare, it is an existing problem, and its known as <em>Hash Collision</em>.</p>

<p>Can you immagine if hashing was reversible? Hard drives would be reduntant since we would be able to hash thousands of GBs into a small string of text and reverse them as we pleased. It would be the <em>nirvana</em> of data compression and storage.</p>

","<p>Hash functions are one way tickets. You cannot use them for encryption.</p>

<p>Hash function algorithms are realised through modulo, xor and other familiar (one way) operations.</p>

<p>You may try to find what argument was used to generate hash but in theory you will never be 100% sure it is the correct value.</p>

<p>For example try with a really simple (useless in cryptography) hash function modulo 10. This function returns ten different values. If it's 7 you may guess the entry was 7 or 137 and 1234567. Same with md5, sha1 and better ones.</p>

<p>As you can see, in the case when you are using hash function that returns only 40 bytes with files that are much bigger (maybe even few hundred megabytes) there in theory exists infinite numbers of files for each possible hash.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism_detection"" rel=""noreferrer"">Plagiarism detection</a> is a special case of similarity detection. This is a big field of study that's almost as old as computer science its self. There is a <em>lot</em> of published research, and there just isn't a single simple answer.</p>

<p>See, eg, <a href=""http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=code+similarity+plagiarism&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5"" rel=""noreferrer"">a Google Scholar search for ""code similarity plagiarism""</a> or <a href=""http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=plagiarism+detection&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5"" rel=""noreferrer"">""plagiarism detection""</a>. Regular Google searches for things like <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/search?q=source+code+similarity+detection+algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">""source code similarity detection algorithm""</a> can also be useful.</p>

<p>There are plenty of <a href=""http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/assessment/plagiarism/detectiontools_sourcecode.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">existing tools</a> in the space, too, so I'm surprised you're trying to write your own.</p>

<p>As you've noted, a check-sum won't do the job unless the code is perfectly identical. Techniques that can help include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Building word-frequency histograms and comparing them</p></li>
<li><p>Extracting comment text and looking for copied comments using text-substring matching</p></li>
<li><p>Extracting variable, class and method names and looking for other code that uses the same names. You have to do a lot of correction for ""obvious"" names that everyone will choose, and for names that're dictated by the problem, like implementing a particular interface or API. Private class member variables and the local variables inside a function or method are the most useful to compare. You will need the help of a compiler or at least syntax parser for the language to extract these.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking for differences in indenting style. Did the user use all-spaces indenting, except for this one function that's indented with tabs?</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing parse trees or token streams to strip out the effects of formatting. You'd usually have to compare individual functions, etc, not just the code as a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>... and lots more</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What you'll have to do is produce a report that weighs all these factors and others and presents them to a human so the human can make a decision. Your tool should explain <em>why</em> it thinks two results are similar, not just that they are similar.</p>

","<p>How i would aproach this, and custom enhancements can be added lately:</p>

<p>Remove everything that is not a letter or number;</p>

<p>Use <code>explode()</code> with empty space character as delimiter and find all the words; now you know how many words you have in that article;</p>

<p>Now, you must find out how many times a word apears in that article, and increase the word indicator each time that word is found in the text;</p>

<p>Store this into an array, like:</p>

<pre><code>$words['wordX']++;
</code></pre>

<p>Do this also with the seccond article that you want to check with;</p>

<p>Now, compare them; You know the original data; some conclusions ca be made at this step;</p>

<p>Using the big characters, like J from John, F from Feudalism, you can also make some conclusions;</p>

<p>From here you may know if the article is about the same thing, and this could be the real step #1</p>

<p>Now, somehow you have to parse both articles, word by word, in the same time, and see the differecnce beetween them.</p>

<p>A student can add a own ""original"" sentence after each sentence/paragraph found in the original article.</p>

<p>Make sure that if you advance to much in the parsing process on one of the articles, you somehow keep a balanced parsing process and try to parse the seccond article until you reach that balance.</p>

<p>i see 2 <code>for</code> instructions, maybe 3, or instead of 3, a function that tryes to keep the balance in the parsing process.</p>

<p>Also, you have to use <code>explode()</code> and check sentence by sentence, and word by word from each sentence and find the similarity.</p>

<p>I am sure that you get the idea, but i say again, you cant parse the entire WWW.</p>

","<p>But is it worth it? If you have a hash for each file, then you essentially have an overhead for each file. Let's say that each file must take up <em>at least</em> 512 bytes (a typical disk sector) and that you're storing these hashes compactly enough so as to not have each hash take up much more than the hash size.</p>

<p>So, even if all your files are 512 bytes, the smallest, you're talking either <code>16 / 512 = 3.1%</code> or <code>32 / 512 = 6.3%</code>. In reality, I'd bet your average file size is higher (unless all your files are 1 sector...), so that overhead would be less.</p>

<p>Now, the amount of space you need for hashes scales linearly with the number of files you have. Is that extra space worth <em>that</em> much? Even if you had your mentioned trillion files - that's <code>1 000 000 000 000 * 16 = ~29 TiB</code>, which is a lot of space, but keep in mind: your data would be <code>1 000 000 000 000 * 512 = 465 TiB</code>. The numbers are worthless, really, since it's still <code>3%</code> or <code>6%</code> overhead. But at this level, where you have a half petabyte of storage, does 15 terabytes matter? At any level, does a <code>3%</code> savings mean anything? And remember, if they're larger, you save less. (Which, they probably are: good luck getting a 512 byte sector size at that hard disk size.)</p>

<p>So, is this <code>3%</code> or less disk savings worth the potential risk in security. (Which I'll leave unanswered, as it's waaay not my cup of tea.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, could you, say, group files together in some logical fashion, so that you have less files? (I mean, if you have trillions of 512 byte files, do you really want to hash every byte on disk?)</p>

","<p>Windows Server 2012 does not appear to provide the TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite needed to get rid of this error.

You will note that Windows Server 2012 does have this cipher suite and I found that upgrading to 2016 was the best way for me to resolve the Google error. Please note that if you upgrade to Windows Server 2016 you will again need to use your IIS_Crypto 2.0 program to order the ciphers appropriately (or whatever ordering interface you choose).  Using the Best Practices template will get you there. I chose their cipher order which yields TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 at the top of the list.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>By default git only shows 7 characters as the odds are it will be unique, and you can refer to commits/blobs using just enough characters to define it as unique. </p>

<p>However, under the hood it still using the full hash. If your git tree has two commits with the same first 7 numbers, then it will throw an error if you only use 7 characters to identify one of those commits.</p>

<p>If the user is entering the hash for data that the system already knows about, then allow the user to enter as many characters as he thinks he needs, and if that isn't enough to uniquely identify which hash he is talking about, then error and prompt for more.</p>

<p>7 hex characters gives ~ 2x10^7 possible hashes. Assuming you are using a good hash - i.e. it has an even spread across the values then by square approximation you have a 50% chance of a duplicate after ~19k* hashes. Whether this is acceptable to you depends on how many you are inserting</p>

<p>*The number of inserts to get a 50% chance of a hash collision for a hash of <code>N</code> hex characters is approximately <code>0.5+sqrt(0.25-(2xln(0.5)x16^N))</code></p>

","<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.hashids.org/""><code>hashids</code></a>, which is designed to generate unique YouTube-style hashes from your primary keys (or some other set of unique numbers). It's not really a hash in the sense that MD5 and SHA-1 are, as it's designed to be reversible.</p>

<p>As an example, if you want to ""hash"" your single integer primary key, you may get a relationship like</p>

<pre><code>(PK: 1) &lt;=&gt; (hashid: 8dY0qQ)
</code></pre>

<p>This is seeded from a secret value that you control, so users are not able to determine the primary key they're really referencing. If your database is somewhat more involved, say with multiple shards and complex keys, you're still okay. <code>hashids</code> takes a list of integers as input:</p>

<pre><code>(3, 171, 24) &lt;=&gt; (243j7Z)
</code></pre>

<p>As the developer, you are responsible for defining the hash's <em>minimum</em> length. As you generate more and more hashes, <code>hashids</code> may generate slightly longer hashes.</p>

<p>Hashes are guaranteed to be unique for a given input (initial seed, minimum hash length, and list of integers to hash):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are <strong>no collisions</strong>. Your generated hashes should be unique. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>
","<p>Try including the -I option for compilation specifying the openssl directory when compiling your example program.</p>

<p>This is from the INSTALL file in the openssl directory:</p>

<pre><code>  *  WRITING applications

     To write an application that is able to handle both the new
     and the old directory layout, so that it can still be compiled
     with library versions up to OpenSSL 0.9.2b without bothering
     the user, you can proceed as follows:

     -  Always use the new filename of OpenSSL header files,
        e.g. #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;.

     -  Create a directory ""incl"" that contains only a symbolic
        link named ""openssl"", which points to the ""include"" directory
        of OpenSSL.
        For example, your application's Makefile might contain the
        following rule, if OPENSSLDIR is a pathname (absolute or
        relative) of the directory where OpenSSL resides:

        incl/openssl:
                -mkdir incl
                cd $(OPENSSLDIR) # Check whether the directory really exists
                -ln -s `cd $(OPENSSLDIR); pwd`/include incl/openssl

        You will have to add ""incl/openssl"" to the dependencies
        of those C files that include some OpenSSL header file.

     -  Add ""-Iincl"" to your CFLAGS.

     With these additions, the OpenSSL header files will be available
     under both name variants if an old library version is used:
     Your application can reach them under names like &lt;openssl/foo.h&gt;,
     while the header files still are able to #include each other
     with names of the form &lt;foo.h&gt;.

<p>When a user logs in, I want to do a check on his password. If it's still in plain text, it should get converted to a secure form.</p>
","<p>I'm a bit confused by this question. </p>

<p>When a user enters his or her password on your website, you can assume that the value in <code>$_POST['password']</code> (or whatever you name it) is in plain text. Even if the user is using the result of a hash function as their password, that doesn't matter, since as far as your application is concerned, it's still plain text. That is, the hashed value <em>is</em> the users password, no matter the steps they took to create it, as the entry of <em>that value</em> into the system results in access for that user. The point of hashing user-submitted passwords on the server is so that even <em>you</em> don't know that users password. That way, if your database is compromised, the users password isn't revealed. </p>

<p>Once you have the password, you retrieve that users salt and hashed password from the database. You take the submitted form, hash it with the user-specific salt, then compare it to the pre-hashed password from the database. If the hashed submission and the pre-hashed database values match, then you can assume the correct password was entered.</p>

<p>The only reason I can see for doing things as you describe, is if you had previously stored your passwords in plain text, and are now in the process of converting them all to hashes. In that case, you should simply assign each user a unique salt, hash their current plain-text password + salt, and store that as their new password. This conversion should occur all at once, when the ""hashwords"" are enabled, rather than doing it piecemeal as the users login for the first time post-transition.</p>

","<p>You can hash the user password when he/she submit the form, this require javascript ofcourse.</p>

<pre><code>function myOnSubmit(aForm) {
    //Getting the password input object
    var inputPassword = aForm['password'];

    //Hashing the password before submitting
    inputPassword.value = sha512_hash(inputPassword.value);

    //Submitting

"20754279","Creating signed URLs for Google Cloud Storage using NodeJS","<p>I'm trying to create a signature for a privately stored file in Google Cloud Storage; so that I can distribute a time-limited link.</p>

<p>Currently doing this and it makes a signature that's too short ... where am I going wrong?</p>

<pre><code>var crypto = require(""crypto"");

var ttl = new Date().getTime() + 3600;
var id = 'the_target_file.txt';
var bucketName = 'bucket_name';
var POLICY_JSON = ""GET\n"" + ""\n"" + ""\n"" + ttl + ""\n"" + '/' + bucketName + '/' + id;

// stringify and encode the policy
var stringPolicy = JSON.stringify(POLICY_JSON);
var base64Policy = Buffer(stringPolicy, ""utf-8"").toString(""base64"");

// sign the base64 encoded policy
var privateKey = ""MY_PRIVATE_KEY"";
var sha256 = crypto.createHmac(""sha256"", privateKey);
var signature = sha256.update(new Buffer(base64Policy, ""utf-8"")).digest(""base64"");

console.log ( signature );
</code></pre>
","<p>Assuming this question is to sign the CDN url backed by google bucket backend, here what works for me (code above did not work for me). </p>

<p>Opts and signing function calling: </p>

<pre><code>const signUrlOptions = {
  expires: '' + new Date().getTime() + 3600, // one hour
  keyName: '_SIGNING_KEY_NAME_', // URL signing key name (the one one you created in the CDN backend bucket)
  keyBase64: '_SIGNING_KEY_BASE64_', // the URL signing key base64 content (base64-encoded, 128-bit value, ~24 characters)
  baseUrl: '_CDN_BASE_URL_' // your base CDN URL (can be IP http://123.... when dev env or https://cdn_dns_name or https dns name)
}

const signedUrl = signCdnUrl('demo.png', signedUrlOptions);
</code></pre>

<p>signing function:</p>

<pre><code>import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

const BASE64_REPLACE = { '+': '-', '/': '_', '=': '' };

export function signCdnUrl(fileName, opts) {
  // URL to sign
  const urlToSign = `${opts.baseUrl}/${fileName}?Expires=${opts.expires}&amp;KeyName=${opts.keyName}`;

  // Compute signature
  const keyBuffer = Buffer.from(opts.keyBase64, 'base64');
  let signature = createHmac('sha1', keyBuffer).update(urlToSign).digest('base64');
  signature = signature.replace(/[+/=]/g, c =&gt; (&lt;any&gt;BASE64_REPLACE)[c]); // might be a better way

  // Add signature to urlToSign and return signedUrl
  return urlToSign + `&amp;Signature=${signature}`;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps. Somehow google cloud doc does not have a nodejs example and the file.getSignedUrl() add confusion to the mix as it does not seem to be related to CDN URL signing. </p>

<p>Note: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Probably want to move base64 -> buffer work to the caller as opts.keyBuffer </p>

","<p>You can find the documentation of OAuth 1.0 <a href=""http://oauth.net/core/1.0/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, more precisely for your problem (sub)chapters  </p>

<ul>
<li>9.2. HMAC-SHA1</li>
<li>Appendix A.5.1. Generating Signature Base String </li>
<li>Appendix A.5.2. Calculating Signature Value  </li>
</ul>

<p>According to documentation the <strong>Signature Base String</strong> is formed as:
<code>HTTP_METHOD&amp;urlencode(BASE_URL_OF_RESOURCE)&amp;urlencode(PARAMETERS_ORDERED_AND_NORMALIZED_AND_WITHOUT_OAUTHSIGNATURE)</code> </p>

<p>The <strong>key</strong> used for hasing is:<br>
  <code>urlencode(CONSUMER_SECRET)&amp;urlencode(OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET)</code>  - when you have a token secret<br>
  <code>urlencode(CONSUMER_SECRET)&amp;</code>  - when you don't have a token secret (on the very beginning when requesting a ""Request Token"")</p>

<p>The final signature should be <code>base64_encode(hash_hmac('SHA1', $signatureBaseString, $key, 1));</code></p>

<p>I put an example script so you can use/test/see how it works:</p>

<p>Also you can do some reverse engineering in magento. For example when requesting an ""Request Token"" the flow is:  </p>

<pre><code>Mage_Oauth_InitiateController::indexAction()
Mage_Oauth_Model_Server::initiateToken()
Mage_Oauth_Model_Server::_processRequest()
Mage_Oauth_Model_Server::_validateSignature()
Zend_Oauth_Http_Utility::sign()
Zend_Oauth_Signature_Hmac::sign()
Zend_Oauth_Signature_SignatureAbstract::_getBaseSignatureString()

<p>How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?</p>
","<p>The Go code you have is the right way to compute sha256 of a stream of bytes.</p>

<p>Most likely the answer is that what you want to do is not sha256. Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>one would have to separate it into two 64 bits of data and hash them individually before hashing the results together. If one was to often change some bits in the second half of the data, one could simplify the calculations and hash the first half of the data only once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is not a valid way to calculate sha256 (read <a href=""http://doc.golang.org/src/pkg/crypto/sha256/sha256.go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.golang.org/src/pkg/crypto/sha256/sha256.go</a> to e.g. see that sha256 does its work on blocks of data, which must be padded etc.). </p>

<p>The algorithm you described calculates something, but not sha256. </p>

<p>Since you know the expected value you presumably have some reference implementation of your algorithm in another language so just do a line-by-line port to Go.</p>

<p>Finally, it's a dubious optimization in any case. 128 bits is 16 bytes. Hashing cost is usually proportional to the size of data. At 16 bytes, the cost is so small that the additional work of trying to be clever by splitting data in 8 byte parts will likely cost more than what you saved.</p>

<p>How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?</p>
","<p>I ran two Go benchmarks on your 128 bytes of data, using an Intel i5 2.70 GHz CPU. First,  1,000 times, I wrote all 128 bytes to the SHA256 hash and read the sum, which took a total of about 9,285,000 nanoseconds. Second, I wrote the first 64 bytes to the SHA256 hash once and then, 1,000 times, I wrote the second 64 bytes to a copy of the SHA256 hash and read the sum, which took a total of about 6,492,371 nanoseconds. The second benchmark, which assumed the first 64 bytes are invariant, ran in 30% less time than the first benchmark.</p>

<p>Using the first method, you could calculate about 9,305,331,179 SHA256 128-byte sums per day before buying a faster CPU. Using the second method, you could calculate 13,307,927,103 SHA256 128-byte sums per day, assuming the first 64 bytes are invariant 1,000 times in a row, before buying a faster CPU. How many SHA256 128-byte sums per day do you need to calculate? For how many SHA256 128-byte sums per day are the first 64 bytes are invariant?</p>

<p>How do I calculate a midstate SHA-256 hash in Google Go?</p>
","<p>Bitcoin-related byte operations are a bit tricky, as they tend to switch endianness at a whim. First of, we take the initial []byte array representing</p>

<pre><code>00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca064f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d89b574a864db8345b1b00b5ac00000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we separate out the first half of the array, obtaining:</p>

<pre><code>00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca06 4f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d8
</code></pre>

<p>After that, we need to swap some bytes around. We reverse the order of bytes in every slice of 4 bytes, thusly obtaining:</p>

<pre><code>0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F
</code></pre>

<p>And that is the array we will be using for calculating the midstate. Now, we need to alter the file <code>hash.go</code>, adding to <code>type Hash interface</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Midstate() []byte
</code></pre>

<p>And change the file <code>sha256.go</code>, adding this function:</p>

<pre><code>func (d *digest) Midstate() []byte {
    var answer []byte
    for i:=0;i&lt;len(d.h);i++{
        answer=append(answer[:], Uint322Hex(d.h[i])...)
    }
    return answer
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>Uint322Hex</code> converts an <code>uint32</code> variable into a <code>[]byte</code> variable. Having all that, we can call:</p>

<pre><code>var h BitSHA.Hash = BitSHA.New()
h.Write(Str2Hex(""0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F""))
log.Printf(""%X"", h.Midstate())
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>Str2Hex</code> turns a <code>string</code> into <code>[]byte</code>. The result is:</p>

<pre><code>69FC72E76DB0E764615A858F483E3566E42D56B2BC7A03ADCE9492887010EDA8
</code></pre>

<p>Remembering the proper answer:</p>

<pre><code>e772fc6964e7b06d8f855a6166353e48b2562de4ad037abc889294cea8ed1070
</code></pre>

<p>We can compare them:</p>

<pre><code>69FC72E7 6DB0E764 615A858F 483E3566 E42D56B2 BC7A03AD CE949288 7010EDA8
e772fc69 64e7b06d 8f855a61 66353e48 b2562de4 ad037abc 889294ce a8ed1070
</code></pre>

<p>So we can see that we just need to swap the bytes around a bit in each slice of 4 bytes and we will have the proper ""midstate"" used by Bitcoin pools and miners (until it will no longer be needed due to being deprecated).</p>

<p>If they are secure or not, highly depends on what you want to protect. If you are building an online banking system, they are not recommended at all (depending where in the online banking system they come to use). If you implement them just for online user password hashing, for example, it also depends on: is you website worth cracking, how many users you have, etc.</p>

<p>A general advice, is to first study the level of security you want to achieve in you scenario and decide what technologies (in this case hashing) you use. There is also no 100% security. Also don't invest too much time into one security issues and ignore others which might not be as obvious or technical (human errors, security by obscurity, human engineering).</p>

","<p>When discussing hash security vs brute force shouldn't we take some more in account?</p>

<p>First of all, is md5 obfuscated data stored in trusted zone or not. In other words, do we trust our db admin not to try read user passwords from the database and brute force reverse them. This can be trusted or technically granted via some security procedures (db admin may not have access to the table that stores password hashes, this may be accessible for security officer only).</p>

<p>Another one is possibility of login+password hash pair hijacking from client or client-server transaction. If there's no trojan horse in the client and the communication between client and server is TLS-secured, the pair should be secure from man-in-the-middle attacks. </p>

<p>What is left for the attacker is (apart from social engineering, xss and hosting security break) to subsequently send number of generated requests to the logon server and see if one is successful. This can be managed too:</p>

<ul>
<li>after both successful and unsuccessful login there may be some random
lag time before the service responds to slow down brute force process</li>
<li>login process may queue parallel login requests from same IP and parallel logins with same login name (to enforce the rule above)</li>
<li>there may be limit implemented for unsuccessful logins, after it is exceeded the account is locked and security alert is launched</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe when above rules are implemented the md5 hash is secure enough. In fact it is equally secure as plain password :) To sum it up if we believe our md5 hash is secure we may simply leave passwords uncovered. The twist is nowadays there is no use of md5 at all (in the matter of password obfuscating). What one should do is leave it plain in the storage in the trusted zone or use some stronger tool (like SHA) when trusted zone is not to be managed. And in my opinion the trusted zone is still under risk of server (hosting service) security break, so no matter of all simply obfuscate the passwords with SHA (or better) :) This shouldn't be costly to harden password hashing itself and it brings some benefits (reduces risks) so my advice is never to revisit this discussion again.</p>

<p>Still even with SHA hashing all the spoken security rules should be implemented. Especially TLS which prevents compromising login+password pair (no matter password is sent plain or hashed with md5 or sha it may enable successful login). Also login attempts should be monitored. Even if we believe our site is brute-force-proof it is good to know someone is trying to break security. </p>

"7112664","Converting a unique seed string into a random, yet deterministic, float value in Ruby","<p>I'm having a hard time with this, conceptually.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to accept some arbitrary unique string, and be able to convert that to a normalized float value.  What the output float value is doesn't really matter, so long as the same string input always results in the same normalized float output.</p>

<p>So this is a hashing algorithm right? I'm familiar with SHA1 or MD5, and this seems similar to password hashing where the result is the same for the correct password.  But those methods output strings of characters, I believe.  And what I'm not getting is how I would turn the result of a SHA1 or MD5 into a consistent float value.</p>

<pre><code># Goal
def string_to_float(seed_string)
  # ...

string_to_float('abc-123') #=&gt; 0.15789
string_to_float('abc-123') #=&gt; 0.15789

string_to_float('def-456') #=&gt; 0.57654
string_to_float('def-456') #=&gt; 0.57654
</code></pre>

<p>So what kind of approach in Ruby can I take that would turn an arbitrary string into a random but consistent float value?</p>
","<p>Yes, you are describing a hashing algorithm.  You could use a MD5 or SHA1 digest (since they just produce random bits) to generate a floating point number simply by using the <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html#M001112"" rel=""nofollow""><code>String#unpack</code> method</a> with an argument of ""G"" (double-precision float, network byte order) from a digest:</p>

<pre class=""lang-ruby prettyprint-override""><code>require 'digest/sha1'

def string_to_float(str)
  Digest::SHA1.digest(str).unpack(""G"")[0]
end

string_to_float(""abc-123"") # =&gt; -2.86011943713676e-154
string_to_float(""def-456"") # =&gt; -1.13232994606094e+214
string_to_float(""abc-123"") # =&gt; -2.86011943713676e-154 OK!
string_to_float(""def-456"") # =&gt; -1.13232994606094e+214 OK!
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you want the resulting floats to be in a particular range then you'll need to do some massaging.</p>

<p>Also note that the unpacked number doesn't use all of the bits from the digest so you might want to combine into the number of bytes for a double floating point number (although you'll have to be careful not to decrease the entropy of the hash function, if you care about that sort of thing), e.g.:</p>

","<p>The key part that you want is a way of converting a SHA1 or MD5 hash output into a float that is both deterministic and 1-1. Here's a simple solution based on md5. This could be used as integers too.</p>

<pre><code>require 'digest/md5'

class String
  def float_hash
    (Digest::MD5.hexdigest(self).to_i(16)).to_f
  end
end

puts ""example_string"".float_hash  # returns 1.3084281619666243e+38
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a hexadecimal hash, then converts it to an integer, then converts that to a float. Each step is deterministic.</p>

<p>Note: as pointed out by @emboss, this reduces collision resistance because a double is 8 bytes and the hash is 16 bytes. It shouldn't be a big deal though by the sounds of your application.</p>

","<p>If security is no issue, what you are describing is in my opinion <em>not</em> a hash function. A hash function is a one-way function, meaning computing the hash is easy but reverting it is ""hard"" or, ideally, impossible.</p>

<p>Your requirements instead describe an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function"" rel=""noreferrer"">injective function</a> Given any x1, x2 in your domain X the following holds:</p>

<pre><code>For all x1, x2 element of X, x1 != x2  =&gt; f(x1) != f(x2)
</code></pre>

<p>f(x) = x is such a function, f(x) = x² is not. In plain English: you want to have different results if your inputs are different, same results only if the inputs are the same. It is true that this also is true for secure hashes, but they additionally provide the one-way characteristics such as the property of not being able (easily) to find x if you are only given f(x), among others. As far as I understood, you don't need these security properties.</p>

<p>Trivially, such an injective mapping from String to Float would be given by simply interpreting the ""String bytes"" as ""Float bytes"" from now on, i.e. you interpret the bytes differently (think C:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char *bytes = ""..."";
double d = (double)bytes; 
</code></pre>

<p>). But, there is as downside to this - the real trouble is that Float has a maximum precision, so you will run into an overflow situation if your strings are too long (Floats are internally represented as <code>double</code> values, that's 8 bytes on a 32 bit machine). So not enough space for almost any use case. Even MD5-ing your strings first doesn't solve the problem - MD5 output is already 16 bytes long.</p>

<p>So this could be a real problem, depending on your exact requirements. Although MD5 (or any other hash) will mess sufficiently with the input to make it as random as possible, you still cut the range of possible values from 16 bytes to effectively 8 bytes. (Note: Truncating random 16 byte output at 8 bytes is generally considered ""secure"" in terms of preserving the randomness. Elliptic Curve Cryptography does something similar. But as far as I know, nobody can really prove it, but neither could someone prove the contrary so far). So a collision is much more likely with your restricted Float range. By the birthday paradox, finding a collision takes sqrt(number of values in a finite range) tries. For MD5 this is 2^64, but for your scheme it's only 2^32. That's still very, very unlikely to produce a collision. It's probably something in the order of winning the lottery while at the same time being hit by a lightning. If you could live with this minimal possibility, go for it:</p>

<pre><code>def string_to_float(str)
  Digest::MD5.new.digest(str).unpack('D')
end
</code></pre>

<p>If uniqueness is of absolute priority I would recommend to move from floats to integers. Ruby has built-in support for large integers that are not restricted by the internal constraints of a <code>long</code> value (that's what a Fixnum boils down to). So any arbitrary hash output could be represented as a large integer number.</p>

","<p>On top of my head I do not know any fast C++ library. Computing a hash is relative straightforward, so any C library will be as easy to use (you can easily wrap it in a C++ class yourself). I found the following site where a guy implemented several hashing algorithms in x86 assembly and compared them to ""official"" C implementations of the same algorithms:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-sha1-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-sha1-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly</a><br>

<p>Those implementations should be a good starting point and then you just have to make the file I/O as efficient as possible. Memory-mapped I/O is usually very efficient, or then you could go complex and use two threads: one thread reads chunks from the file and the other thread hashes the read data. The idea here would be to always keep the process doing something useful, i.e. hashes can be calculated while waiting for more data to be read from the file.</p>

<a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/vote-note.php?id=107483&amp;page=book.mcrypt&amp;vote=down"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.php.net/manual/vote-note.php?id=107483&amp;page=book.mcrypt&amp;vote=down</a></p>

<p>So, I changed it a little bit and I did this:</p>

<pre><code>class EncrypterDecrypter {

private $SECRET = ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"";


function encrypt($decrypted, $salt = 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz') {
    $password = $this-&gt;SECRET;
    // Build a 256-bit $key which is a SHA256 hash of $salt and $password.
    $key = hash('SHA256', $salt . $password, true);
    // Build $iv and $iv_base64.  We use a block size of 128 bits (AES compliant) and CBC mode.  (Note: ECB mode is inadequate as IV is not used.)
    srand();
    $iv = mcrypt_create_iv(mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC), MCRYPT_RAND);
    if (strlen($iv_base64 = rtrim(base64_encode($iv), '=')) != 22)
        return false;
    // Encrypt $decrypted and an MD5 of $decrypted using $key.  MD5 is fine to use here because it's just to verify successful decryption.
    $encrypted = base64_encode(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $decrypted . md5($decrypted), MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv));
    // We're done!
    return $iv_base64 . $encrypted;
}

public function decrypt($encrypted, $salt = 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz') {
    $password = $this-&gt;SECRET;
    // Build a 256-bit $key which is a SHA256 hash of $salt and $password.
    $key = hash('SHA256', $salt . $password, true);
    // Retrieve $iv which is the first 22 characters plus ==, base64_decoded.
    $iv = base64_decode(substr($encrypted, 0, 22) . '==');
    // Remove $iv from $encrypted.
    $encrypted = substr($encrypted, 22);
    // Decrypt the data.  rtrim won't corrupt the data because the last 32 characters are the md5 hash; thus any \0 character has to be padding.
    $decrypted = rtrim(
            mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128,
                    $key, base64_decode($encrypted),

    // Remove the last 32 characters from $decrypted.
    $decrypted = substr($decrypted, 0, -32);
    // Integrity check.  If this fails, either the data is corrupted, or the password/salt was incorrect.
    if (md5($decrypted) != $hash)
        return false;
    // Yay!
    return $decrypted;
   }
}

","<p>You are definitely on the right track, bcrypt is a very nice way to store your passwords (scrypt is better but hard to find a good implementation in PHP).</p>

<p>Remember that sha1, sha256, sha512 were <em>never</em> made to hash passwords. They were designed to be fast, so that you could take large data sets and create a unique signature for them, in the <em>shortest amount of time</em>. They are used for signing more than anything else.</p>

<p>You definitely want to use a hashing algorithm that takes <em>more</em> time.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Some would argue that the pepper is pointless, since if they hack your system, they will have access to your salts and pepper.</p>

","<p>I do not understand what you mean when you say: ""even if it was salted"". Salting happens before hashing, it offers some protection against rainbow table attacks and users using the same password on multiple sites. Depending on the base a simple regex can tell you if a particular string is a sha256 hash. i think most times we encounter hashes in base16, in that case this would work:</p>

<p>I tried setting the password to <code>admin</code> which is the same provided for the default user: admin, password: admin by the configuration file in order to check that the password generated by my <code>create</code> method matches.</p>

<p>However, the hashed password in the configuration file is <code>8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918</code> but the one stored in the database is a weird set of characters when I inspect my <code>mysql</code> database via console or  <code>ivAMgsKo*H</code> when displayed in a page.</p>

<p>Any help? </p>
","<p>Finally I came up with this solution, thank to @Oleg Estekhin comment:</p>

<pre><code>public String sha256(String original) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");

<p>My question is not duplicate of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2954784/sha256-in-t-sql-stored-procedure"">SHA256 in T-sql stored procedure</a> as I am looking for the SHA256 <strong>base 64</strong> version of the algorithm which is not listed in the page.</p>

<p><strong>Numeric Example</strong></p>

<p>I have this query result in SQL Server</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start date,End date,POD,Amount,Currency </p>
  
  <p>2016-01-01,2016-12-31,1234567890,12000,EUR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this give me the following string (using <em>concatenate</em> function) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2016-01-012016-12-31123456789012000EUR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>whit <a href=""http://approsto.com/sha-generator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this convertion tool</a> I get the following hash </p>

<blockquote>

","<p>First, the generator link you provided outputs the base64 representation in not exactly correct format. Namely, it omits the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Output_Padding"" rel=""noreferrer"">padding sequence</a>. Though theoretically optional, padding is mandatory in MS SQL Server (tested on 2012 and 2016 versions).</p>

<p>With this in mind, the following code gives you what you need:</p>

<pre><code>declare @s varchar(max), @hb varbinary(128), @h64 varchar(128);

select @s = '2016-01-012016-12-31123456789012000EUR';

set @hb = hashbytes('sha2_256', @s);
set @h64 = cast(N'' as xml).value('xs:base64Binary(sql:variable(""@hb""))', 'varchar(128)');

select @hb as [BinaryHash], @h64 as [64Hash];
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from the aforementioned padding, there is another caveat for you to look for. Make sure that the input string is always of the same type, that is, either always <code>varchar</code> or always <code>nvarchar</code>. If some of your hashes will be calculated from ASCII strings and some from UTF-16, results will be completely different. Depending on which languages are used in your system, it might make sense to always convert the plain text to <code>nvarchar</code> before hashing.</p>

","<p>They are almost equivalent.</p>

<p>The difference is how the encoding for the string is established.</p>

<p>In the first portion of code it assumes ASCII, whereas in the second portion it assumes UTF-8. It is possible that the string used another encoding which is none of those.</p>

<p>But regardless of that, the idea is to understand what is the goal of this operation. The truly relevant things in this context are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given equal input, output should be the same</li>
<li>There should be no way to retrieve the plaintext only by knowing the output (within a reasonable amount of time)</li>
<li>After hashing, you no longer require the original input in plaintext.</li>
</ol>

<p>A secure cryptographic hashing function (meaning not older functions like MD5) achieves that.</p>

<p>Then, if your data store where hashes are stored is compromised, the attacker would only have a hash which cannot be used to retrieved the original plaintext. This is why hashing is used rather than encryption, encryption is a reversible operation (through decryption).</p>

<p>Then, within the system, if you've made the decision to use one encoding, you need to keep that decision consistent across all components in your system so they can interoperate.</p>

"24066318","How to generate RSA SHA signature using OpenSSL in C","<p>I need some help using OpenSSL to generate a signature of a block of data using C (Windows and Linux). The application has to do with Google authentication.  The instructions from Google's documentation are:</p>

<p>""Sign the UTF-8 representation of the input using SHA256withRSA (also known as RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN
with the SHA-256 hash function) with the private key obtained from the Google Developers Console. The
output will be a byte array.""</p>

<p>The private key is a .p12 file containing 1660 bytes of binary data.</p>

<p>Do I use the RSA_sign() API for this?  If so am I supposed to hash the data first?  Using what
key value?  I assume the RSA * parameter is supposed to hold the private key?  How does it get
loaded?  I have used the HMAC function to generate a SHA hash, but I'm a bit lost here - any help
or sample code would be appreciated.  (And yes, I know Google has libraries to do this, but none
for C, which I need to use).</p>
","<p>You can use <code>RSA_sign</code> to sign the data with SHA256 hash. You can call this</p>

<pre><code>RSA_sign(NID_sha256, digest, digest_len, &amp;sign_buffer, sign_len, rsa_key);
</code></pre>

<p>You have calculate SHA256 hash of the data into <code>digest</code> buffer. <code>rsa_key</code> should be initialized.</p>

<p>Since, you have <code>.p12</code> file, you need to do the following.</p>

<p>Create <code>PKCS12</code> structure from <code>.p12</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>PKCS12 * p12 = d2i_PKCS12_fp(fp_to_p12_file, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Parse the <code>p12</code> structure to certificate and key.</p>

<pre><code>PKCS12_parse(p12, passphrase, &amp;evp_pkey, &amp;x509_cert, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>It will give <code>EVP_PKEY</code> structure from which you can get <code>RSA</code> structure using <code>EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA</code> or access <code>evp_pkey-&gt;pkey.rsa</code> member of the structure.</p>

<p>This should help you to start.</p>

Convert to hex notation gives 20 hex values, i.e 40 characters<br>
Lop of last 8 characters to give a Guid<br>
Email User Gui and Email address which they enter into program 
Program verifies this pairing by taking the email address, adding salt, encrypting ectera
and checking generates a valid guid.   </p>

<p>My main problem with this is that I need to store the salt in the program somewhere, therefore if the hacker finds the salt and works out what Im doing they can create a valid license key generator for any email address.  </p>

<p><strong>My current method for another program:</strong></p>

<p>I have generated a public key/private key pair<br>

I generate a license by signing the emailaddress<br>
BaseEncode the generated license<br>

Program verifies license by basedecoding and decrypting with public key   </p>

<p>My problem has been that when I sign the emailaddress is too long so I end up putting it in a file instead of the user entering it into a field, but maybe the problem is that I am base64encoding rather than converting to Hex.</p>

<p>How long can the output of signing be, does it depend on the length of the input or is it always the same ?</p>

<p>Because I decrypt the key with the public key I canot lop some chars of the license key, but if the generate key is only 40 characters I guess that is okay</p>

<p>I think the advantage of this method is that even if hacker works out how I'm doing things, they cannot create a license generator because they do not, and cannot get the private key because it is only stored on my server. They could only generate licenses if they created a new private/public key pairing and then if my application had the public key encoded in itself  the application could reject the license anyway.</p>

","<p>You may just hash the user info concatenated with a ""secret"" salt and then truncate the hash.</p>

<p>The length of the license key is at least determined by the signature key length - a 1024 bit key produces a 128 byte license (if no other payload is added). </p>

<p>Often the license file consists of more information on the licensed use itself, like validity period, licensed submodules, throughput... - the signature itself is embedded within this structure. This way you gain flexibility and i strongly advise this solution, even if the license gets even bigger.</p>

<p>For importing the license in an application you can adopt a hybrid way (like we did). On one hand you can provide the classic ""import license file"" solution. On the other, we generate a random, short ID (like your GUID) and associate it with the license data. Upon registration the user enters the the short ID and the application looks up the complete license via HTTP. You must be online only once, you can still provide complex licenses and the user only needs a short ID.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<ol>
<li>The length of s signature is the length of the key. E.g. 1024 bit (or 128 byte)</li>
<li>You can use this signature alone if your application knows what data is signed (e.g. the mail)</li>
<li>You can sign a ""license document"" containing more properties than only the mail. In this case the license contains  property AND signature (and is, accordingly, longer than only the signature)</li>
<li>You dont need online connection for license check. Just import a license with the application and check whenever you like.</li>
<li>An addition to license file import you CAN adopt an online download of the license file using a short ID as a key. The license is downloaded and offline. So you have the best of both worlds.</li>

<p>Given that dyld's error when trying to run my app under Yosemite always refers to one of the libraries that only has a sha256 hash, my working theory is that OS/X 10.10.x's dyld is ancient enough that it doesn't know about SHA-256 hashes, and that is why it is erroring out when it tries to load a captive shared library that is signed only with an SHA-256 hash.</p>

<p>My question (assuming I'm not completely barking up the wrong tree here) is:  how does codesign decide when to stamp a file with sha256 hash alone, vs adding both an sha1 and an sha256 hash?  And how can I force codesign to always include both hashes, so that my app can launch under 10.10.x again (like it used to before we upgraded our build machine to OSX/Sierra)?</p>

<p>For the record, here is how I'm invoking codesign in my build script -- the invocation arguments are exactly the same for all libraries (both the Qt framework libraries that end up with sha1,sha256 and the non-Qt libraries that end up with only sha256), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>codesign -f -v -s ""Developer ID Application:  MyCompanyName"" ""./Frameworks/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib""
codesign -f -v -s ""Developer ID Application:  MyCompanyName"" ""./Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore""
</code></pre>
","<p>After a lot of googling around, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/40980658/131930"">this answer</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/17148833/131930"">this answer</a> led me to the solution.</p>

<p>The problem was that several of the third-party shared libraries included inside my app were being compiled using just their default build settings (e.g. ""./configure; make""), and since they were being compiled under OS/X 10.12, naturally they were compiled with only 10.12-compatibility in mind.</p>

<p>In order to get them to compile in such a way that the resulting .dylib files would be appropriate for earlier OS/X versions as well, I added these lines to the top of my build script:</p>

<pre><code>export  LDFLAGS=""-mmacosx-version-min=10.9""   
export   CFLAGS=""-mmacosx-version-min=10.9""   
export CXXFLAGS=""-mmacosx-version-min=10.9""
</code></pre>

<p>... and that did the trick for all of the libraries (libssh2, libsndfile, libogg, libflac, libvorbis, etc) except for the libssl -- for that one I had to hand-modify the Configure file and insert the -mmacosx-version-min argument into the compiler's command-line arguments that way.</p>

<p>With that change, codesign now applies both SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes to all of the .dylib files, and the resulting .app now runs as expected under 10.10.x.</p>

<h2>Creating X-Hub-Signature Header like GitHub API Webhook Requests</h2>

<p>My purpose in all this was to simulate the <a href=""https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/#validating-payloads-from-github"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>X-Hub-Signature</code></a> header provided by the <a href=""https://developer.github.com/webhooks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub Webhooks API</a> because my web service validates all webhook payloads to match the signature.

<p>Here's an adaptation of the above code snippet for generating the <code>X-Hub-Signature</code> request header value.</p>

<ol>
<li>In GitHub, I set a <a href=""https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">webhook secret</a> for my <a href=""https://developer.github.com/apps/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub App</a>.</li>

<li>In Postman, I created an <a href=""https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">environment</a> and added the key=value pair <code>GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code> with the value I specified when I created my GitHub App.</li>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>In Postman, I used the following pre-request script. It set the computed hash as a global variable.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>const hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(
    request.data,
    pm.environment.get('GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
);
pm.globals.set('X-HUB-SIGNATURE', 'sha1=' + hash);
</code></pre>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>In Postman, I reference the global hash variable as a header in my requests, just like the GitHub Webhooks API will.</li>

The code below has a <code>private static SHA1</code> member (which is an <code>IDisposable</code> but since it's <code>static</code>, it should never get finalized). However, under stress this code throws an exception that suggests it has been closed:</p>

<p>You should not share these classes between threads where different threads try and call <code>ComputeHash</code> on the same instance at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
This is what is causing your error. The stress test below yields a variety of errors due to multiple threads calling ComputeHash on the same hash algorithm instance. Your error is one of them.</p>

<p>Specifically, I have seen the following errors with this stress test:</p>

","<p>The bottleneck is that the whole file must be streamed/copied over the network, and your seems to look good...
the different hash functions (md5/sha256/sha512) have almost the same computation time  </p>

<p>Two possible solutions for this problem:</p>

<p>1) run a hasher on the remote system and store the hashes in to separate files - if that is possible in your environment.</p>

<p>2) Create a part-wise hash of the file, so that you only copy a part of the file.
I mean something like that:</p>

<pre><code>part1Hash = md5(file.getXXXBytesFromFileAtPosition1)
part2Hash = md5(file.getXXXBytesFromFileAtPosition2)
part3Hash = md5(file.getXXXBytesFromFileAtPosition3)
finalHash = part1Hash ^ part2Hash ^ part3Hash;

","<p>One possible approach would be to make use of the parallel task library in .Net 4.0.  100Mbps will still be a bottleneck, but you should see a modest improvement.</p>

Running over a 10Mbps WAN it took about 7 minutes to complete one of our large file shares.  When I parallelised the operation the execution time came down to a bit over 1 minute.</p>

<p>1000 is the number of passes, and 128 is the key size. The function returns a binary key which I use base64 to store it in the database.</p>

<p>My question is: what's the recommended keysize and salt size for pbkdf2 using sha512?</p>

<p>will a keysize of 32 be just as secure as a keysize of 128?</p>
","<p>1000 is the number of iterations, not passes. 128 Is the length at the end.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> (and my own little knowledge about cryptography) you should use more than 128 bits (or 32 as you're asking). The size of the resulting key is equivalent to the chance for a hash collision. Using 256 (as WPA2 does) or 512 should not be a problem, also not a problem for your CPU/memory/whatever.</p>

<p>Also 1000 is, compared to other integrations of pbkdf2, a very small amount of iterations. You can easily use 5000 or 10000 (like iOS4) which might result in something like 10ms more processing time but makes a way more stronger key (see: a possible attacker has also to run the 10k iterations. This might change the time he needs from 1 day to 10 days, or 1 month to almost 1 year).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Suppose you have a database that contains password hashes for the n users of your site, and for each user you have salt si and hash hi (where hi was computed with some algorithm such as SHA1 or MD5).  (Note that the rest of these instructions work if there's no salt, just ignore it).</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that you've chosen to use scrypt.  For each user you first create a new random salt value s'i and then compute a new hash h'i using the formula scrypt(s'i, hi) and store the new salt and hash in the database.  You throw away the old weak hash hi and forget it ever existed. So you are left with two salt values and a new hash.  (I've ignored the other scrypt parameters which are left to the reader to determine).</p></li>
<li><p>When user i logs in and presents password p you use your old weak hash algorithm (let's suppose it was md5(salt, password)) to compute a hash for comparison as follows: scrypt(s'i,  md5(si, p)) and compare that with the h'i stored in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>If, like last.fm, you were also allowing third-parties to authorize users by presenting the old hash value instead of the password then you can still use this scheme.  When the third-party presents hash h for user i you calculate scrypt(s'i,  h) and do the comparison.</p></li>
<li><p>If step 4 is not needed then you can go further when a user logs in.  Once the user has logged in successfully with password p you can completely eliminate any trace of the old weak hash by choosing a new random salt value s''i and computing scrypt(s''i,  p) and storing that in the database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This has the effect of immediately making your password database more secure if stolen without any effort on the part of your users.</p>

<p>As I stated in my comments, hashing passwords is something that you probably shouldn't be doing yourself.</p>

<p>A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>SHA1 is not recommended for passwords</li>
<li>Passwords should be salted</li>
<li>You should use a verified userstore framework rather than attempting to create your own, as you will likely ""do it wrong""</li>
<li>I'm sure there are many more</li>
</ul>

<p><em>That being said</em>, to accomplish your specific question, you would want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Users
----
userId
passwordHashed
</code></pre>

<p>passwordHashed stores a hashed version of the user's password (the plain text password is never stored anywhere in persistence.)</p>

<p>for checking for valid password something like this is done:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER procedure [dbo].[proc_UserLogin]
 @userid varchar(20),
  @password nvarchar(50)
  As 

  declare
  @ReturnVal              varchar(500)


SET NOCOUNT ON      

  if exists(select userid,password from LoginManager where userid=@userid and password=HASHBYTES('SHA1', @password))
  set @ReturnVal='0|Logged in Successfully'
  else
  set @ReturnVal='1|Login Failed/Username does not exist'

  select @ReturnVal
</code></pre>

<p>For inserting/updating user passwords, you need to make sure to store the hashed password not the plain text password, as such;</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO users(userId, passwordHashed) 
VALUES (@userId, HASHBYTES('SHA1', @rawPassword)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE users 
SET passwordHased = HASHBYTES('SHA1', @rawPassword) 
WHERE userId = @userId
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>just realized you're asking how to accomplish the hash in C#, not SQL.  You could perform the following (taken from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17292366/hashing-with-sha1-algorithm-in-c-sharp"">Hashing with SHA1 Algorithm in C#</a>):</p>

<pre><code>public string Hash(byte [] temp)
{
    using (SHA1Managed sha1 = new SHA1Managed())
    {
        var hash = sha1.ComputeHash(temp);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your code snip could be:</p>

<pre><code>            conn.Open();
            string query = ""EXEC dbo.proc_UserLogin'"" + username.Text+ ""', '"" + this.Hash(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password.Text))+""'"";
            OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(query, conn);
</code></pre>

<p>You should also note that you should parameterize your parameters to your stored procedure rather than passing them in the manner you are - which it looks like you already have a separate question in regarding that.</p>

I was planning on using MD5 or SHA2 keys to identify matching files even if they have been renamed/moved, etc. I'm not trying to match MP3's that are logically equivalent (i.e.: same song but encoded differently). I have about 8000 MP3's. Only about 6700 of them generated unique keys.</p>

<p>My problem is that I'm running into collisions regardless of the hashing algorithm I choose. In one case, I have two files that happen to be tracks #1 and #2 on the same album, they are different file sizes yet produce identical hash keys whether I use MD5, SHA2-256, SHA2-512, etc...</p>

<p>This is the first time I'm really using hash keys on files and this is an unexpected result. I feel something fishy is going on here from the little I know about these hashing algorithms. Could this be an issue related to MP3's or Python's implementation?</p>

<p>Here's the snippet of code that I'm using:</p>

    m.update(data)

I tried the same under Python 2.7.1 and 2.6.6 and both provide the same result.</p>

","<p>I sort of have the feeling that you are reading a chunk of data which is smaller than the expected, and this chunk happens to be the same for both files. I don't know why, but try to open the file in binary with 'rb'. read() should read up to end of file, but windows behaves differently. From the docs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Windows, 'b' appended to the mode
  opens the file in binary mode, so
  there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb',
  and 'r+b'. Python on Windows makes a
  distinction between text and binary
  files; the end-of-line characters in
  text files are automatically altered
  slightly when data is read or written.
  This behind-the-scenes modification to
  file data is fine for ASCII text
  files, but it’ll corrupt binary data
  like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be
  very careful to use binary mode when
  reading and writing such files. On
  Unix, it doesn’t hurt to append a 'b'
  to the mode, so you can use it
  platform-independently for all binary
  files.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The data to be signed needed to be formatted correctly in a
DigestInfo DER-encoded byte array.  The Signature SHA1withRSA takes
care of this for you, but if you want to accomplish it in a two-step
process, you need to create your own DigestInfo.  I ended up copying
a very minimal amount of ASN.1 classes from BouncyCastle into my
project to accomplish this, despite my desire not to use a third
party lib.</p></li>
<li><p>If you try to use the Cipher API to encrypt the DigestInfo, the
PKCS1 padding will be random and not appropriate for a digital
signature.  I needed static padding.</p></li>
<li><p>The Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"", ""SunMSCAPI"") rejects the
DER-encoded DigestInfo format, and will return an error if you try
to sign that data.  But, since I ultimately wanted to use the PKCS11
API to generate the signature, I ended up signing the DER-encoded
DigestInfo with the PKCS11 C_SignInit and C_Sign functions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To summarize, what worked for me was:</p>

<ol>
<li>generate the SHA-1 hash of the data to sign using the Java MessageDigest API </li>
<li>generated a DigestInfo DER-encoded ASN.1 object with the SHA-1 hash and SHA-1 OID embedded in the object. </li>
<li>signed the DigestInfo using the PKCS11 C_Sign function from a third party library.</li>

","<p>emsworth's answer was when a great help for me when struggling with the same issue (but using SHA512). However it is still missing a hint which takes me a few more days to find out by myself.</p>

<p>There are different ways how the signature is constructed. For example when using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (from RFC 5246, TLS 1.2) the DER-encoded DigestInfo is not obtained the usual way. For example if using BouncyCastle</p>

<pre><code>DigestInfo digestInfo = new DigestInfo(new AlgorithmIdentifier(NISTObjectIdentifiers.id_sha512), hash);
byte[] digestedHash = digestInfo.getEncoded(ASN1Encoding.DER);
</code></pre>

<p>does not yield the expected results. RFC 3447 defines how to construct the DER encoding on page 42. For example in case of SHA-512 the DER encoding is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// code example includes MessageDigest for the sake of completeness
byte[] input = ... // the raw data
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-512"");
md.update(input);
byte[] hash = md.digest();

// Taken from RFC 3447, page 42 for SHA-512, create input for signing
byte[] modifierBytes = { 0x30, 0x51, 0x30, 0x0d, 0x06, 0x09, 0x60, (byte) 0x86, 0x48, 0x01, 0x65, 0x03, 0x04, 0x02, 0x03, 0x05, 0x00, 0x04, 0x40 };
ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
baos.write(modifierBytes);
baos2.write(hash);

// create signature
Signature s = Signature.getInstance(""NONEwithRSA"");
s.initSign(MyTlsCredentials.THE_CLIENT_KEY);
s.update(baos.toByteArray());
byte[] signature = s.sign();

// add prefix as specified in RFC 3447, im my case it had always been the shown values
// but I have not understand the RFC completely in this point as the code seems to be
// contradictious to the interpretation of the byte values for the hash function from page 42.
ByteArrayOutputStream baos2 = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
baos2.write(new byte[] { 1, 0 });
baos2.write(signature5);

In the worst case, if your message is exactly 64 bits short of a full block, you will add a <code>1</code> and then 511 <code>0</code>s before the ""number"" bits, but that is how the padding has to work.</p>

<pre><code>struct KeyData

"44499389","Creating a CSR with a PEM formatted Key","<p>I have run into a CSR generation problem I can't seem to explain and was wondering if someone could either help me with my command, or tell me what I am generating.</p>

<p>I think I am generating CRT Certificates in PEM format, but it seems my key is not in PEM format !?</p>

<p>Here is what I do, and what I get.
I create a CSR with:</p>

<p><code>openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -out test.csr</code></p>

<p>This generate 2 files:
<strong>privkey.pem</strong> and <strong>test.csr</strong> </p>

<p>Now when I try and update some servers, they complain that my Private key is not in PEM format. <em>nginx and apache seem happy with my key.</em></p>

<p>When I then convert the key with:</p>

<p><code>openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out privkey.rsa.pem</code></p>

<p>It works !?! </p>

<p>vimdiff shows me the difference in the files visually, and one can see that not only is the heading different, but the content is also been changed (after the first 4 characters)</p>

<p><strong>And thus my question</strong></p>

<p>is the key created in DER - PEM format, even though I specify not to use DER in the create line ?</p>
","<p>The only way I have found to generate a key in RSA format is to first create the keyfile with </p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out ./yourkeyfile.key 2048
</code></pre>

<p>and then use the file to create a CSR with </p>

<pre><code>openssl req -new -sha256 -key yourkeyfile.key -out yourcsrfile.csr
</code></pre>

<p>If you use the one line command the keyfile is created in DER format.</p>

<p>I have verified that hash is <code>64</code> bytes long and it returns a <code>CryptographicException: Bad Hash</code>. But if I use <code>myHash</code> var (20 bytes long), although algorithm specified in <code>SignHash</code> is <code>SHA512</code>, it works, and sign the hash using <code>SHA1</code> algorithm.</p>

<p>Also, if I print <code>csp.SignatureAlgorithm</code>, its value is <a href=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1</a>.

Could be this point the real problem? If so, how could I create the certificate properly? Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>This process has been simplified in .NET 4.6:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] signature;

using (RSA rsa = cert.GetRSAPrivateKey())
{
    signature = rsa.SignHash(hash, HashAlgorithmName.SHA512, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the .NET 4.6 RSA type no longer requires casting to RSACryptoServiceProvider, and if you use GetRSAPrivateKey() (instead of the PrivateKey property) the returned object is likely to handle SHA-512 signature generation.  GetRSAPrivateKey also returns a unique object each time, so you should Dispose it appropriately. </p>

","<p>You can increase your hashing algorithm security by using HMAC, a secret key, and a unique salt per entry (I know people will disagree with me on this but it's my belief from my research that it helps avoid certain attacks). You can also use bcrypt or scrypt to hash which will make reversing the hash an extremely time consuming process (but you'll also have to factor this in as time it takes your app to compute the hash).</p>

<p>By disabling code downloads and keeping your secret key protected, I can't imagine how someone can get a hold of it. Just make sure your code is kept protected under similar safe guards or that you remove the secret key from your code during development and only pull it out to deploy. I assume you will keep your secret key in your code (I've heard many people say to keep it in memory to be ultra secure but given the nature of AppEngine and instances, this isn't feasible).</p>

<p>Update:
Be sure to enable 2-factor authentication for all Google accounts that have admin rights to your app. Google offers this so not sure if your restriction for enabling this was imposed by an outside force or not.</p>

","<p>When deciding on a security architecture, the first thing in your mind should always be threat models. Who are your potential attackers, what are their capabilities, and how can you defend against them? Without a clear idea of your threat model, you've got no way to assess whether or not your proposed security measures are sufficient, or even if they're necessary.</p>

<p>From your text, I'm guessing you're seeking to protect against some subset of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>An attacker who compromises your datastore data, but not your application code.</li>
<li>An attacker who obtains access to credentials to access the admin console of your app and can deploy new code.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the former, encrypting or hashing your datastore data is likely sufficient (but see the caveats later in this answer). Protecting against the latter is tougher, but as long as your admin users can't execute arbitrary code without deploying a new app version, storing your keys in a module that's not checked in to source control, as you suggest, ought to work just fine, since even with admin access, they can't recover the keys, nor can they deploy a new version that reveals the keys to them. Make sure to disable downloading of source, obviously.</p>

<p>You rightly note some concerns about hashing of data with a limited amount of entropy - and you're right to be concerned. To some degree, salts can help with this by preventing precomputation attacks, and key stretching, such as that employed in PBKDF2, scrypt, and bcrypt, can make your attacker's life harder by increasing the amount of work they have to do. However, with something like SSN, your keyspace is simply so small that no amount of key stretching is going to help - if you hash the data, and the attacker gets the hash, they will be able to determine the original SSN.</p>

<p>In such situations, your only viable approach is to encrypt the data with a secret key. Now your attacker is forced to brute-force the key in order to get the data, a challenge that is orders of magnitude harder.</p>

<p>In short, my recommendation would be to encrypt your data using a standard (private key) cipher, with the key stored in a module not in source control. Using hashing instead will only weaken your data, while using public key cryptography doesn't provide appreciable security against any plausible threat model that you don't already have by using a standard cipher.</p>

<p>Of course, the number one way to protect your users' data is to not store it in the first place, if you can. :)</p>

<p><strong>If we ever need to re-hash the data or otherwise deal with it in a raw form:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Decrypt the encrypted version with our private key. Never store it in raw form, just process it then re-hash &amp; re-encrypt it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My concerns</h2>

<p><strong>Keeping our hash salt secret</strong></p>

<p>If an attacker gets ahold of the data in the datastore, as well as our hash salt, I'm worried they could brute force the sensitive data. Some of it (like SSN, a 9-digit number) does not have a big key space, so even with a modern hash algorithm I believe it could be done if the attacker knew the salt.</p>

<p>My current idea is to keep the salt out of source control and in it's own file. That file gets loaded on to GAE during deployment and the app reads the file when it needs to hash incoming data. </p>

<p>In between deployments the salt file lives on a USB key protected by an angry bear (or a safe deposit box). </p>

<p>With the salt only living in two places</p>

<ol>
<li>The USB key</li>
<li>Deployed to google apps</li>
</ol>

<p>and with code download permanently disabled, I can't think of a way for someone to get ahold of the salt without stealing that USB key. Am I missing something?</p>

<p><strong>Keeping our private RSA key secret</strong></p>

<p>Less worried about this. It will be rare that we'll need to decrypt the encrypted version (only if we change the hash algorithm or data format).  </p>

<p>The private key never has to touch the GAE server, we can pull down the encrypted data, decrypt it locally, process it, and re-upload the encrypted / hashed versions.</p>

<p>We can keep our RSA private key on a USB stick guarded by a bear AND a tiger, and only bring it out when we need it.</p>

<hr>

<p>I realize this question isn't exactly google apps specific, but I think GAE makes the situation somewhat unique. </p>

<p>If I had total control, I'd do things like lock down deployment access and access to the datastore viewer with two-factor authentication, but those options aren't available at the moment (Having a GAE specific password is good, but I like having RSA tokens involved).</p>

<p>I'm also neither a GAE expert nor a security expert, so if there's a hole I'm missing or something I'm not thinking of specific to the platform, I would love to hear it.</p>
","<p>Interesting approach to encrypt data on a datastore. After going through this, one question that comes to my mind is how do you query data on your hashes? Are you using comparison of two hashes or more fine grained hashing? Again how do you accomplish operations like greater than value, less than value after hashing and encrypting the data in your table?</p>

<p><a href=""http://harisankar-krishnaswamy.blogspot.in/2013/07/securing-data-on-appengine-and-other.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Fine grained hashing</a> meaning, do you hash consecutive bytes of a data stream to get the accumulated hash. i.e hash(abcd) = hash(a,b) + hash (b,c) + etc. This type of hashing would tell how similar the underlying data are rather than a match.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I've also seen this error when copy->paste the thumbprint from certmgr.msc into the .cscfg files.  This is because non-printable chars are actually copied to the clipboard and pasted into the thumbprint attribute.  Removing these chars by putting your cursor just before the first visible character in the hash and backspacing, alleviates the issue.</p>

","<p><strong>Yes, Azure does support certificates that use SHA256.</strong></p>

<p>To clarify, the Azure is looking at the thumbprint algorithm not the  signature hash algorithm in the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg.  The thumbprint is the value used to pull the certificate from the certificate store and is unrelated to the Signature Hash Algorithm.</p>

<p>In the ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg file, the XML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Certificates&gt;
  &lt;Certificate name=""cert"" thumbprint=""REDACTED"" thumbprintAlgorithm=""sha1"" /&gt;
&lt;/Certificates&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the above XML in the config specifies the thumbprint algorithm, which is SHA1 even in the case of your certificate that uses SHA256 for Signature Hash Algorithm, if your thumbprint was hashed using SHA256, you would have other schema validation problems because the hash is a different length then SHA1.</p>

","<p>Your signature is a 20 byte (160 bit) long byte array.
So it's basically a very long number.</p>

<p>When you show it, you are converting it into a hex string, so each byte is shown as 2 chars, so you get a 40 chars long string.</p>

<p>Base64 encoding gives you 4 chars every 3 bytes of payload to encode.</p>

<p>If you encode in base64 20 bytes of binary data you get 26.6 bytes, rounded up to 28 (you round up every 4 bytes).
If you encode your 40 characters long string (320 bits), you get 53,3 characters, again rounded up to 56.</p>

","<p>It comes down to whether or not the developer is happy with you 'hotlinking' to the JS library.  </p>

<p>Regarding the specific URL that you have posted, </p>

<pre><code>https://raw.github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA/master/src/sha1.js
</code></pre>

<p>I would be wary of referencing that.  It is the master branch of their source code, they may include breaking changes at any time.  They may even decide to move and restructure their codebase, in which case your application will break as the URL above will lead to a 404.</p>

<p>The better solution is indeed referencing a specific version of the library.  This ensures that your application behaves, and will continue to behave, in an expected and known manner as far as the jsSHA library is concerned.  </p>

<p>There are a few ways to do this.  You can reference a specific, fixed URL that explicitly specifies a version</p>

<pre><code>http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.0.2/build/rollups/hmac-sha1.js
</code></pre>

<p>Because its tagged (3.0.2), you are a bit safer, but you are still referencing source control.  This should really be done via a CDN if one exists.  I do not believe that the googlecode.com URL is a CDN URL (I could be wrong).  It is of course a common practice to use a proper CDN or external link to reference a JS library and you can see an <a href=""http://jquery.com/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">example of this on the JQuery page</a>, but this is often done as part of page performance enhancements.  A CDN is optimized for a user's geographic location so a reference to any content on a CDN (as opposed to the main server) will be served faster.  It has user experience benefits.  It's useful if page load times are important for your userbase.</p>

<p>The alternative, and the safest way, is to keep a copy of the JS library in your own source control and reference it using your own infrastructure.  It's with you, it is a fixed version and there are no surprises if something changes, such as restructuring, sites going down, and so on. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>You do not want the first visit a potential user makes to your website to be slow and disappointing. If your first-time visitor has visited my site which uses this URL for jQuery, her browser will probably have cached it so it will not need to load it.</p></li>
<li><p>Using immutable versioned resources (jquery/1.8.0 instead of something like jquery/current) both helps developers not have to track down breaking changes in their production code and ensures that these resources can be cached.</p></li>
<li><p>If the resource has to be downloaded and the URL is hosted on a CDN you are likely to get lower latency as the resource will probably be loaded from a server closer to the user's network.

</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine except for the password attribute. For example, if I change only the user first name, the password is also changed.</p>

<p>I want to know how to deal with an encoded password (using the SHA - Secure Hashing Algorithm).</p>

<p>I don't see any annotations allowing to specify the encoding method.</p>

<p>Do we have to deal with it manually?</p>
","<h2>Short version</h2>

<pre><code>@Attribute(name = ""userPassword"", type = Type.BINARY)
private byte[] password;
</code></pre>

<p>is the correct definition of your password attribute. This is because LDAP stores the password as binary too.</p>

<p>To provide a convenient way of interaction, you should modify the setter for <code>password</code></p>

<pre><code>public void setPassword(String password) {
    this.password = password.getBytes(Charset.forName(""UTF-8""));
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Long version</h2>

<p>The problem is your definition of <code>userPassword</code>. It is a java.lang.String. And the Spring LDAP ODM Attribute annotation defaults to Type.STRING</p>

<p>Your LDAP gets the string as byte array and checks if it has a proper prefix (in our case <code>{SSHA}</code>). If there is no prefix present it hashes the given string with its configured hash algorithm and stores it in the attribute as binary. Here lays the root cause. Your attribute definition differs. LDAP has a binary, you have a string.</p>

<p>When you read the entry again, to modify the first name, the password attribute gets read too. But, as it should be a string in the object, Spring converts the binary array to a string. This conversion is wrong, as it creates a string.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>you put <code>test</code> in the password field of your entity object.</li>
<li>Spring takes the string and sends it <em>unmodified</em> to the LDAP server.</li>
<li>the server hashes the string and saves it as <code>{SSHA}H97JD...</code></li>
<li>you read the entry again</li>
<li><p>spring gets a byte[] containing the ascii numbers representing the stored value</p>

<p><code>[123, 83, 83, 72, 65, 125, 72, 57, 55, 74, 68, ...]</code></p></li>
<li><p>a conversion to a string results in the following:</p>

<p><code>123,83,83,72,65,125,72,57,55,74,68,...</code></p></li>
<li><p>spring sets this string in your entity as password value</p></li>
<li>you modify the first name</li>
<li>spring takes the password string again and sends it as is to the server</li>
<li>the servers prefix check indicates an unhashed password and applies the hash algorithm again on the string, because <code>123,83,</code> starts not with <code>{SSHA}</code></li>
<li>the server changes the password again.</li>
</ul>

","<p>Seems you are missing the ""encodeHexString"" method - instead of including the whole jar, use any easy implementation around... for example:</p>

private static String encodeHexString(byte[] bytes) {
    char[] hexChars = new char[bytes.length * 2];

    for (int j = 0; j &lt; bytes.length; j++) {
        v = bytes[j] &amp; 0xFF;
        hexChars[j * 2] = hexArray[v &gt;&gt;&gt; 4];
        hexChars[j * 2 + 1] = hexArray[v &amp; 0x0F];
    }
    return new String(hexChars);
}

"19962424","Probability of collision with truncated SHA-256 hash","<p>I have a database-driven web application where the primary keys of all data rows are obfuscated as follows: SHA256(content type + primary key + secret), truncated to the first 8 characters. The content type is a simple word, e.g. ""post"" or ""message"" and the secret is a 20-30 char ASCII constant. The result is stored in a separate indexed column for fast DB lookup.</p>

<p>How do I calculate the probability of a hash collision in this scenario? I am not a mathematician at all, but a friend claimed that due to the Birthday Paradox the collision probability would be ~1% for 10,000 rows with an 8-char truncation. Is there any truth to this claim?</p>
","<p>Yes, there is a collision probability &amp; it's probably somewhat too high. The exact probability depends on what ""8 characters"" means.</p>

<p>Does ""8 characters"" mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>A) You store 8 hex characters of the hash?  That would store 32 bits.</li>
<li>B) You store 8 characters of BASE-64? That would store 48 bits.</li>
<li>C) You store 8 bytes, encoded in some single-byte charset/ or hacked in some broken way into a character encoding?  That would store 56-64 bits, but if you don't do encoding right you'll encounter character conversion problems.</li>
<li>D) You store 8 bytes, as bytes? That genuinely stores 64 bits of the hash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Storing binary data as either A) hex or D) binary bytes, would be my preferred options. But I'd definitely recommend either reconsidering your ""key obfuscation"" scheme or significantly expanding the stored key-size to reduce the (currently excessive) probability of key collision.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem</a></p>

<p>The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions: the expected number of N-bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2^N, but rather only 2^(N/2).</p>

<p>Since in the most conservative above understanding of your design (reading it as A, 8 chars of hex == 32 bits) your scheme would be expected to suffer collisions if it stored on the scale of ~64,000 rows. I would consider such an outcome unacceptable for all serious, or even toy, systems.</p>

<p>Transaction tables may have volumes, allowing growth for the business, from 1000 - 100,000 transactions/day (or more). Systems should be designed to function 100 years (36500 days), with a 10x growth factor built in, so.. </p>

<p>For your keying mechanism to be genuinely robust &amp; professionally useful, you would need to be able to scale it up to potentially handle ~36 billion (2^35) rows without collision. That would imply 70+ bits of hash.</p>

<p>The source-control system Git, for example, stores 160 bits of SHA-1 hash (40 chars of hex == 20 bytes or 160 bits). Collisions would not be expected to be probable with &lt; less than 2^80 different file revisions stored.</p>

<hr>

<p>A possibility better design might be, rather than hashing &amp; pseudo-randomizing the key entirely &amp; hoping (against hope) to avoid collisions, to prepend/ append/ fold-in 8-10 bits of a hash <em>into</em> the key.</p>

<p>This would generates a larger key, containing all the uniqueness of the original key plus 8-10 bits of verification.  Attempts to access keys would then be verified, and more than 3 invalid requests would be treated as an attempt to violate security by ""probing"" the keyspace &amp; would trigger semi-permanent lockout. </p>

<p>The only major costs here, would be a modest reduction in the size of the available keyspace for a given int-size.  32-bit int to/from the browser would have 8-10 bits dedicated to security, thus leaving 22-24 for the actual key. So you'd use 64-bit ints where that was not sufficient.</p>

"23639952","When using SHA-256 hashes as a primary key, is it OK to ignore the possibility of collisions?","<p>I have this situation where I have files on the HDD and I want to cache information about them in a database. Information that would otherwise take a long time to parse given that some of these files can run into GBs. </p>

<p>My first intuition is to use the file path as a unique identifier for a file and I use that as the key (TEXT/VARCHAR) and store the information as value in a database table.</p>

<p>Given that under some file systems (especially in *nix), file paths can be of unlimited length. It seems like a bad idea to use file name as a primary key in a database. Just indexing on a string field is going to be much slower, not to mention memory/space constraints.</p>

<p>I thought, maybe, I generate SHA-256 hash from the full file path (/usr/xxx/1/2/../abc.xyz)  and use this as primary key (fixed width) in my database. Another thought, would be to generate the SHA-256 hash from file contents. However, this can also become quite time consuming. </p>

<p>My question is - in this scenario, are hash collisions as equally less likely, as the answer provided on this excellent <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4014090/is-it-safe-to-ignore-the-possibility-of-sha-collisions-in-practice"">thread</a>.</p>
","<p>To answer your question, you would only be likely have issues with hash collisions if you were to approach 2^128 files in your table. This assumes that all inputs are between 0 .. +INF in length and that the hash algorithm you are using is <em>perfect</em> (SHA-256 is considered <em>perfect</em> in practice but not proven in theory) and that the output size is exactly 256 bits.</p>

<p>If you have under a few billion files, you should be fine.</p>

<p>Now for my recommendation. I would say that you need to tell us more information about your intended use. Your first thought is closer to correct than your hashing approach.</p>

<p>I would use a table like this (T-SQL Syntax for SQL Server):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [File]
(
    [Id] BIGINT IDENTITY NOT NULL,
    [Path] CHARACTER VARYING(MAX) NOT NULL

    PRIMARY KEY([Id])
);

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [File_Path_IX] ON [File]([Path]);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you should let your database take care of indexing and making the searches fast.
If and only if you experience a major performance issue later down the road, demonstrated by profiling, should you consider changing to a hashing approach. The hashing will impose massive computational penalty on your preprocessing and will introduce complicated scenarios such as hash collisions and trying to resolve them if and when they do happen.</p>

All is working nice and I'm using the login form actively but I need a form to create users. My problem is that what I write in the password field is interpreted as an SHA encoded password so when I try to sign in with the new user, I can't. How can I solve this? Is there a way to force Spring to encrypt the password that I write in the password field?</p>
","<h2>At user authentication time</h2>

<p>Spring security's authentication manager should be configured so that it encodes plain text passwords received from the login form using SHA beforehand. </p>

<p>This is explained in <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/springsecurity-single.html#ns-auth-providers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this chapter</a> of Spring Security's documentation, at the paragraph ""Adding a Password Encoder"". It is basically adding this line of configuration : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication-provider&gt;
    &lt;password-encoder hash=""sha""/&gt;
    ...
&lt;/authentication-provider&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>At user creation time</h2>

<p>Before you store a new user, you should encode ""by yourself"" the password, Spring security does not handle it. </p>

<p>In your case, you can use the <code>ShaPasswordEncoder.encodePassword(..)</code> method.</p>

","<p>You should calculate hmac(salt : userid : timestamp+2hours, secret) and transmit salt : userid : timestamp+2hours : hash.

<p>Can these hashing algorithms be broken up to run across multiple cores/threads ?</p>
","<p>If you're wondering about parallelizing the execution of computing a single hash (regardless of flavor 1, 256, or 512) then the answer is sadly no. That is because of the way the SHA transform function is defined. It operates on blocks of fixed size but the output of the transformation of each block is required by next so you can't run the computations in parallel.</p>

<p>Obviously it is possible to run multiple hashes in parallel, for different input strings, but that I assume you already knew.</p>

<p>If all you wanted was to generate digests for large inputs using underlying SHA transforms you could define an arbitrary scheme for segmenting the input and then generating digest blocks for each segment in parallel. Then combine those and so on..</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code> | ------------------ large input ---------------------------------------------|

 |    b0     |    b1    |    b2    |          |          |          |    bn    |
</code></pre>

<p>You can generate <code>H(b0), H(b1), .. H(bn)</code> in parallel.</p>

<p>Then, generate <code>H_OUT = H(H(b0) + H(b1) + .. + H(bn))</code> (where the <code>+</code> sign could be concatenation or a simple XOR but these would very likely <strong>not</strong> be cryptographically strong).</p>

<p>This method will benefit from multiple cores but <code>H_OUT</code> will not be equivalent to computing  a single hash of the original large input.</p>

","<p>Yes, your approach will work.  Remember, though, SHA1 is a general algorithm (not git specific), so it's possible your text could contain other SHA1 hashes in it which will also be 40 character hex strings.</p>

<p>However, when I try to log in I get a <code>Bad credentials</code> error. What is happening?</p>

","<p>Look at the debug log output when you try to authenticate as the user (always a good idea). Most likely it says it can't find the user ""johnny"".</p>

<p>This is most likely because you have both a <code>jdbc-user-service</code> and a <code>user-service</code> in the same <code>authentication-provider</code> which won't work.</p>

<p>Use two separate <code>authentication-provider</code> elements:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication-provider&gt;
    &lt;jdbc-user-service ... /&gt;
&lt;/authentication-provider&gt;
&lt;authentication-provider&gt;
    &lt;user-service&gt;
       ....
    &lt;/user-service&gt;
&lt;/authentication-provider&gt;

"14850674","How much faster is the native implementation of the native cryptographic hashes on Windows than the .Net Managed version?","<p>I'm providing hashes for sets of data in order to fingerprint the data and identify it by hash - this is the core use case for fast hashes like SHA1 and MD5.</p>

<p>In .Net, there is an option to go with the native or managed implementations of some of these hashes (the SHA variants, anyway). I'm looking for an MD5 managed implementation, and there doesn't appear to be one in the .Net Framework, but wondered if the wrapped native CSP is faster anyway, and if I should just use it content that there will be no perf problems using it. The top answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1200602/why-is-there-no-managed-md5-implementation-in-the-net-framework/1200742"">Why is there no managed MD5 implementation in the .NET framework?</a> indicates that faster performance could be the reason that a managed variant doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Is this true, and if so, how much faster is the native CSP?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, the wrapped native CSP for MD5 - <code>MD5CryptoServiceProvider</code> - is significantly slower than a pure managed implementation. It is an obstinate viewpoint that holds that native code is unequivocally faster than managed code: in many cases the opposite is true. This is such a case, at least in head-to-head measurements.</p>

<p>Using the <a href=""http://dlaa.me/blog/post/9380245"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">translated reference MD5 implementation by David Anson</a>, I constructed a <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/rplaire/md5-shootout"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quick performance test</a> (<a href=""https://bitbucket.org/rplaire/md5-shootout/src/1c85f432c375780b4ab909caf721b7edf266cb01/src/MD5Shootout/Program.cs?at=tip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>) which aims to measure any large differences in performance between the two implementations. While for small data arrays the difference are negligible, as expected, at around 16kB the native implementation starts to show potentially significant delay - on the order of milliseconds. This might not seem like much, but it is orders of magnitude slower than the pure managed implementation. This difference is maintained as the size of the data being hashed increases, and at the largest tested data array - ~250MB - the difference in CPU time was about 8.5 seconds. Considering that a hash like this is often used to fingerprint very large files, this extra delay would become noticeable, even against the often much larger delays from I/O.</p>

<p>It's not abundantly clear where the delay comes from, since a pure native test was not performed (one which would dispense with the wrapping of a CSP and consumption in managed code), but given the nearly identical shape of the graphs on the log scale, it would appear that the managed and native implementations have the same intrinsic performance, but that the native code performance is ""shifted"" down in performance likely due to the cost of the interop between native and managed code at runtime. This <a href=""http://byterot.blogspot.de/2013/01/net-framework-cryptography-symmetric-algorithm-performance-benchmark.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">performance difference between wrapped native CSPs and pure managed implementations has also been reproduced and documented by other investigators</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to answering the question ""how much faster is the native implementation"" in this particular case, I hope this evidence serves to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1200742/58391"">prompt more reflection and investigation</a> when the question of native vs. managed arises, breaking the long-standing and pernicious reaction to similar questions that native code is always faster, and thus, somehow, better. Managed code is clearly very fast, even in this performance-sensitive domain of bulk data hashing.</p>

"49565332","The fingerprint you specified is already used by an Android OAuth2 client ID in this project or another project","<p>I noticed my SHA1 number showing from the gradle view signing report in android studio was different from the one I had originally. I thought maybe it was from changing computers a year ago. My game app was still able to access leaderboards and achievements. I when to my Google API dashboard I noticed the 'OAuth client' had my old SHA1. It wouldn't let me change it to my new SHA1, saying it 'had already been used by this client or another client', although I had no other clients. The mysterious 'Anroid client 1' and 'Android client 2' had neither the old or new SHA1. Underneath the 'OAuth client' was 'OAuth client (auto created by google service)' which had my new SHA1. I went ahead and deleted that one, despite a warning it gave me that it had been used 147 times in the last week (evidence of impending senility on my part I suppose). It seemed I had to delete it to free up the number for my 'OAuth client' that was not auto created. </p>

<p>Now it appears I'm screwed, as it still gives me 'the already in use message' when I try to change the SHA1, and my game app can no longer access Google Play Services at all. I'm thinking I should have deleted the 'OAuth client' instead. Can I recover from this? Will it free up over time? Another post suggested 7 days for clients to be removed, although I don't see a button to delete the whole client, and am concerned over the deletion of the API codes on the same page.</p>

<p>EDIT 3/30 - It looks like I may have lost this number permanently, although (I'm hoping) it only affects my Leaderboards and Achievements, not Firebase, Inapp Purchasing, or Ads. I can roll my own Leaderboards and Achievements in Firebase anyway. New projects with different package names give me the same unusable SHA1 in the Gradle signingReport.</p>

","<p>I finally got a useful response from Google support through email, providing just a clue on how to start the recovery process:</p>

<pre><code>I understand you're receiving a Client ID error when trying to link your app to a Game Services project. This error message is displayed because your package ID and SHA1 are already in use by another Client ID.

To resolve this issue, please use the steps below to delete the Client ID from your Google Developers Console (formerly Cloud Console).

Important: Do not delete the Google Developers Console project before deleting the Client ID. If you’ve already deleted the project, you will need to undelete it from your Projects list.

1. Use the following URL to access the project - https://console.developers.google.com/project/186639667931
2. Select APIs &amp; auth &gt; Credentials
3. Under “Client ID for Android application” click the “Delete” button.
4. Try linking your app in the Play Console again. If you’re unable to view or undelete the project linked in step 1, please try accessing it while logged in with the primary email address on your Play developer account.
</code></pre>

<p>There was no 'Client ID for Android application', but there was an 'OAuth Client' under 'OAuth 2.0 client IDs', so I deleted that. That still had an old SHA1 number as it wouldn't take my current one. So I wasn't really deleting something with my current number, but deleting this deleted the whole client and brought up a blank screen. Here there was a bit of a trap. I added my current SHA1 number to that screen, which it accepted. Now I was able to get a response from the Google Play site again from my app, although its response always was 'Cannot access services'. </p>

<p>As it turns out, this screen was the default screen, which is 'Google Play Android Developer'. I'll have to research what this is for sometime, but what I needed to add a SHA1 to was my actual app name. I ultimately found buried in the dropdown list at the very top, next to 'Google APIs', among example apps I had downloaded and 'Google Play Android Developer'. I still couldn't add my current SHA1 to it until I went back and deleted the 'OAuth Client' from 'Google Play Android Developer'. This bought the same default screen back, so I went back to the dropdown, selected my app name, and then was able to finally add my current SHA1 back to it.</p>

<p>So deleting a SHA1 appears not to be a permanent exile from Play Services, just the start of a tricky process to get it reestablished.</p>

<p>It used to be more secure because it forced the attacker to try a, back then, very costly brute-force approach instead of an instant looked in precomputed rainbow tables. If you had a 64 bit salt, the attacker needed to have 2^64 precomputed rainbow tables instead of one...  In other words: it made rainbow tables useless.</p>

<p>Note however that modern GPUs can crack billions of passwords per second making it mostly pointless for an attacker to store huge rainbow tables (instead of storing billions of hashes, simply compute them in a few seconds).</p>

","<p>An attacker is <em>""allowed""</em> to know the salt - your security must be designed in a way that even with the knowledge of the salt it is still secure.</p>

<p><strong>What does the salt do ?</strong></p>

<p>Salt aids in defending against brute-force attacks using pre-computed ""rainbow-tables"".<br/>
Salt makes brute-force much more expensive (in time/memory terms) for the attacker.<br/>
Calculating such a table is expensive and usually only done when it can be used for more than one attack/password.<br/>
IF you use the same salt for all password an attacker could pre-compute such a table and then brute-force your passwords into cleartext... <br/>
As long as you generate a new (best cryptogrpahically strong) random salt for every password you want to store the hash of there is no problem.<br/></p>

<p><strong>IF you want to strengthen the security further</strong><br/>
You could calculate the hash several times over (hash the hash etc.) - this doesn't cost you much but it makes a brute-force attack / calculating ""rainbow-tables"" even more expensive... please don't invent yourself - there are proven standard methods to do so, see for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2</a> and <a href=""http://www.itnewb.com/tutorial/Encrypting-Passwords-with-PHP-for-Storage-Using-the-RSA-PBKDF2-Standard"">http://www.itnewb.com/tutorial/Encrypting-Passwords-with-PHP-for-Storage-Using-the-RSA-PBKDF2-Standard</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> </p>

<p>Using such a mechanism is these days <em>mandatrory</em> since ""CPU time"" (usable for attacks like rainbow tables/brute force etc.) is getting more and more widely available (see for example the fact that Amazon's Cloud service is among the top 50 of fastest supercomuters worldwide and can be used by anyone for a comparatively small amount)!</p>

<p>In short answer to you question, a salt is a safeguard that makes it take a long time to recover a password in the event of compromise just as a hash is. If attacking one password, the salt won't make a difference. If trying to use a pre-computed dictionary or test many passwords at the same time, having a different salt for each entry will greatly increase the amount of work needed and generally make generating a suitable rainbow table infeasible.</p>

"45385707","How to efficiently hash (SHA 256) in golang data where only the last few bytes changes","<p>Assuming you had 80 bytes of data and only the last 4 bytes was constantly changing, how would you efficiently hash the total 80 bytes using Go. In essence, the first 76 bytes are the same, while the last 4 bytes keeps changing. Ideally, you want to keep a copy of the hash digest for the first 76 bytes and just keep changing the last 4.</p>
","<p>You can try the following examples on the <a href=""https://play.golang.org/p/GOiluol-9J"" rel=""noreferrer"">Go Playground</a>. Benchmark results is at the end.</p>

<p>Note: the implementations below are not safe for concurrent use; I intentionally made them like this to be simpler and <em>faster</em>.</p>

<h2>Fastest when using only public API (always hashes all input)</h2>

<p>The general concept and interface of Go's hash algorithms is the <a href=""https://golang.org/pkg/hash/#Hash"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>hash.Hash</code></a> interface. This does not allow you to save the state of the hasher and to return or rewind to the saved state. So using the public hash APIs of the Go standard lib, you always have to calculate the hash from start.</p>

<p>What the public API offers is to reuse an already constructed hasher to calculate the hash of a new input, using the <code>Hash.Reset()</code> method. This is nice so that no (memory) allocations will be needed to calculate multiple hash values. Also you may take advantage of the optional slice that may be passed to <code>Hash.Sum()</code> which is used to append the current hash to. This is nice so that no allocations will be needed to receive the hash results either.</p>

<p>Here's an example that takes advantage of these:</p>

<pre><code>type Cached1 struct {
    hasher hash.Hash
    result [sha256.Size]byte
}

func NewCached1() *Cached1 {
    return &amp;Cached1{hasher: sha256.New()}
}

func (c *Cached1) Sum(data []byte) []byte {
    c.hasher.Reset()
    c.hasher.Write(data)
    return c.hasher.Sum(c.result[:0])
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Test data</h3>

<p>We'll use the following test data:</p>

<pre><code>var fixed = bytes.Repeat([]byte{1}, 76)
var variantA = []byte{1, 1, 1, 1}
var variantB = []byte{2, 2, 2, 2}

var data = append(append([]byte{}, fixed...), variantA...)
var data2 = append(append([]byte{}, fixed...), variantB...)

var c1 = NewCached1()
</code></pre>

<p>First let's get authentic results (to verify if our hasher works correctly):</p>

<pre><code>fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", sha256.Sum256(data))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", sha256.Sum256(data2))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>fb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a
10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's check our <code>Cached1</code> hasher:</p>

<pre><code>fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c1.Sum(data))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c1.Sum(data2))
</code></pre>

<p>Output is the same:</p>

<pre><code>fb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a
10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c
</code></pre>

<h2>Even faster but may break (in future Go releases): hashes only the last 4 bytes</h2>

<p>Now let's see a less flexible solution which truly calculates the hash of the first 76 fixed part only once.</p>

<p>The hasher of the <a href=""https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/sha256/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>crypto/sha256</code></a> package is the unexported <code>sha256.digest</code> type (more precisely a pointer to this type):</p>

<pre><code>// digest represents the partial evaluation of a checksum.
type digest struct {
    h     [8]uint32
    x     [chunk]byte
    nx    int
    len   uint64
    is224 bool // mark if this digest is SHA-224
}
</code></pre>

<p>A value of the <code>digest</code> struct type basically holds the current state of the hasher.</p>

<p>What we may do is feed the hasher the fixed, first 76 bytes, and then <em>save</em> this struct value. When we need to caclulate the hash of some 80 bytes data where the first 76 is the same, we use this saved value as a starting point, and then feed the varying last 4 bytes.</p>

<p>Note that it's enough to simply save this struct value as it contains no pointers and no descriptor types like slices and maps. Else we would also have to make a copy of those, but we're ""lucky"". So this solution would need adjustment if a future implementation of <code>crypto/sha256</code> would add a pointer or slice field for example.</p>

<p>Since <code>sha256.digest</code> is unexported, we can only use reflection (<a href=""https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>reflect</code></a> package) to achieve our goals, which inherently will add some delays to computation.</p>

<p>Example implementation that does this:</p>

<pre><code>type Cached2 struct {
    origv   reflect.Value
    hasherv reflect.Value
    hasher  hash.Hash

    result [sha256.Size]byte
}

func NewCached2(fixed []byte) *Cached2 {
    h := sha256.New()
    h.Write(fixed)

    c := &amp;Cached2{origv: reflect.ValueOf(h).Elem()}
    hasherv := reflect.New(c.origv.Type())
    c.hasher = hasherv.Interface().(hash.Hash)
    c.hasherv = hasherv.Elem()

    return c
}

func (c *Cached2) Sum(data []byte) []byte {
    // Set state of the fixed hash:
    c.hasherv.Set(c.origv)

    c.hasher.Write(data)
    return c.hasher.Sum(c.result[:0])
}
</code></pre>

<p>Testing it:</p>

<pre><code>var c2 = NewCached2(fixed)
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c2.Sum(variantA))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c2.Sum(variantB))
</code></pre>

<p>Output is again the same:</p>

<pre><code>fb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a
10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c
</code></pre>

<p>So it works.</p>

<h2>The ""ultimate"", fastest solution</h2>

<p><code>Cached2</code> could be faster if reflection would not be involved. If we want an even faster solution, simply we can make a copy of the <code>sha256.digest</code> type and its methods into our package, so we can directly use it without having to resort to reflection.</p>

<p>If we do this, we will have access to the <code>digest</code> struct value, and we can simply make a copy of it like:</p>

<pre><code>var d digest
// init d
saved := d
</code></pre>

<p>And restoring it is like:</p>

<pre><code>d = saved
</code></pre>

<p>I simply ""cloned"" the <code>crypto/sha256</code> package to my workspace, and changed / exported the <code>digest</code> type as <code>Digest</code> just for demonstration purposes. Then using this <code>mysha256.Digest</code> type I implemented <code>Cached3</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>type Cached3 struct {
    orig   mysha256.Digest
    result [sha256.Size]byte
}

func NewCached3(fixed []byte) *Cached3 {
    var d mysha256.Digest
    d.Reset()
    d.Write(fixed)

    return &amp;Cached3{orig: d}
}

func (c *Cached3) Sum(data []byte) []byte {
    // Make a copy of the fixed hash:
    d := c.orig
    d.Write(data)
    return d.Sum(c.result[:0])
}
</code></pre>

<p>Testing it:</p>

<pre><code>var c3 = NewCached3(fixed)

fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c3.Sum(variantA))
fmt.Printf(""%x\n"", c3.Sum(variantB))
</code></pre>

<p>Output again is the same. So this works too.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>We can benchmark performance with this code:</p>

<pre><code>func BenchmarkCached1(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
        c1.Sum(data)
        c1.Sum(data2)
    }
}

func BenchmarkCached2(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
        c2.Sum(variantA)
        c2.Sum(variantB)
    }
}

func BenchmarkCached3(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
        c3.Sum(variantA)
        c3.Sum(variantB)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Benchmark results (<code>go test -bench . -benchmem</code>):</p>

<pre><code>BenchmarkCached1-4   1000000     1569 ns/op     0 B/op    0 allocs/op
BenchmarkCached2-4   2000000      926 ns/op     0 B/op    0 allocs/op
BenchmarkCached3-4   2000000      872 ns/op     0 B/op    0 allocs/op
</code></pre>

<p><code>Cached2</code> is approximately <strong>41% faster</strong> than <code>Cached1</code> which is quite noticable and nice. <code>Cached3</code> only gives a ""little"" performance boost compared to <code>Cached2</code>, another <strong>6%</strong>. <code>Cached3</code> is <strong>44%</strong> faster than <code>Cached1</code>.</p>

<p>Also note that none of the solutions use any allocations which is also nice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>For that extra 40% or 44%, I would probably not go for the <code>Cached2</code> or <code>Cached3</code> solutions. Of course it really depends on how important the performance is to you. If it is important, I think the <code>Cached2</code> solution presents a fine compromise between minimum added complexity and the noticeable performance gain. It does pose a threat as future Go implementations may break it; if it is a problem, <code>Cached3</code> solves this by copying the current implementation (and also improves its performance a little).</p>

<p>(NOTE: online hashers will hash ""9a"" as a string resulting in an answer of <code>e8eef065fb7295044d65b305bab18a9a645d1abf</code>. Which is wrong for this application)</p>

<p>Now, I need to embed this type of hashing into my Java program. This is what I got so far (wrapped in try/catch):</p>

<pre><code>String ss = ""9a"";
ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(8);  
byte[] ba = bb.putLong(Long.decode(""0x""+ss).longValue()).array();

<p>What am I doing wrong? </p>

<p>EDIT: Added Hex tag back, it seems obvious that the data has to be in some sort of hex format. As HashCalc has to be set to ""HexString"" and not ""TextString"" which returns a different result. And the solution could well include a change to how Im dealing with these hex numbers. --> which turned out to be true</p>
","<p>I figured it out! Thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/869736/louis-wasserman"">Louis Wasserman</a> for inspiration in his comment to my question. When I used <code>000000000000009a</code> with HashCalc it returned the same result as my function! I realized that I was forcing a certain data length (the length of a <code>long</code>). Turns out it needs to be an arbitrary length (like HashCalc... as I said, I needed to duplicate the HashCalc behavior, not just for <code>9a</code> or what ever small test case we use, but for all possible data). Even longer than <code>long</code>. So these other solutions don't work here.</p>

<p>I got around this by converting the original hex string to a char[] array then concat them together in pairs and converting to a byte, in a loop, storing each in the byte[] that is passed to digest. This worked! Then I saw <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/438742/kan"">Kan's</a> comment to his answer on  this, and showed me I was just reinventing the wheel there.</p>

<p>So here is the final code, and its amazingly the same size as the original:</p>

<pre><code>private String HexToSHA1(String ss) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    MessageDigest md = null;
    try { md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1""); }
    catch ( Exception e ) {}
    return byteArrayToHexString(md.digest(DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(ss)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This runs pretty quick, not sure if there is even a faster way. Of course thats also based on how fast your <code>byteArrayToHexString</code> function is. Here is mine:</p>

<pre><code>private String byteArrayToHexString(byte[] data) {
    char[] toDigits =  {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};
    int l = data.length;
    char[] out = new char[l &lt;&lt; 1];
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i &lt; l; i++) {
        out[j++] = toDigits[(0xF0 &amp; data[i]) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4];
        out[j++] = toDigits[0x0F &amp; data[i]];
    }
    return new String(out);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And its pretty fast. Credit to someone somewhere. I didn't write it.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Moving <code>char[] toDigits =  {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};</code> to the global (or ""up one in scope"") makes it faster still.</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>This is your most immediate problem:</p>

<pre><code>byte pass[] = md.digest();
System.out.println(pass.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>You're not returning the hash of the string. You're returning the result of calling <code>toString()</code> on a <code>byte[]</code>. Arrays in Java don't override <code>toString()</code>, so you get the default implementation, which has everything to do with the identity of the object and <em>nothing</em> to do with the data in the byte array:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Arrays don't override <code>hashCode()</code> either, so that's obtained from the default implementation in <code>Object</code> too...)</p>

<p>Basically, you need a different way of converting a <code>byte[]</code> to a <code>String</code>... or store the byte array directly in the database, of course. If you <em>do</em> want to convert to a string, I suggest you use either hex or base64. For base64, I'd suggest the <a href=""http://iharder.net/base64"" rel=""nofollow"">iharder.net public domain library</a>... or if you're using Java 8, you can use <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Base64.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>java.util.Base64</code></a>. (It's astonishing that it took so long to get a base64 class into the standard libraries in a context other than XML etc, but there we go.)</p>

<pre><code>return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(md.digest());
</code></pre>

<p>Your code has an additional problem though:</p>

<pre><code>md.update(clearTextPassword.getBytes());
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the platform default encoding to convert the password into a byte array. That's not a good idea - it means you could end up getting different hashes based on what system your code is running on. It's better to specify the encoding explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>md.update(clearTextPassword.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, catching an exception if SHA-256 is missing, logging and continuing with a blank string is almost certainly the wrong approach. Do you really want to populate your database with empty strings, allowing anyone to log in with any password? If your system is in that state, the best thing you can do is almost certainly to fail any request to do anything with passwords. You probably want to convert the <code>NoSuchAlgorithmException</code> into some sort of <code>RuntimeException</code> and rethrow.</p>

<p>Finally, storing a simple SHA-256 hash probably isn't a good idea anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li>You probably want an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code"" rel=""nofollow"">HMAC</a> instead</li>
<li>You should <em>at least</em> use a random salt to avoid the same passwords having the same values in the database. (Otherwise, an attacker can use that information to their advantage.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm far from an expert on security, so I won't advise you much further on the right way to do things - but I would actually suggest trying to find a well-respected library written by security experts rather than trying to implement this yourself. Security it very hard to do right.</p>

<p>If someone finds out your salt, then they can reconstruct your hashes and flood your system.  In this case you'd want to make sure that a user requested addition of their e-mail address to whatever you're creating.  (That is, I wouldn't get rid of storing the hash in the DB altogether.)</p>

","<p>MD5 produces an 128 bit hash. (16 byte)
sha, depending of whether is sha1 or sha256 produces either 160 bit (20 byte) or 256 bit (32 byte) hash.
Note that I'm talking about binary length/strength. The longer the less likely a collision occurs.</p>

<p>The fact that most users stick it into a DB field or whatnot makes it convenient to convert it to ASCII using varions binary-ascii conversion algos. This should not influence the strength of collision probability at all since you'll end up with a larger ASCII string.</p>

<p>FWIW I've been using SHA1, SHA256 in crypto products in binary form for over 5 years and I'd recommend choosing hashes in this following order, from the strongest to the weakest: SHA256, SHA1, MD5. There is a website that can ""reverse"" MD5 so I'd strongly suggest against it.</p>

","<p>You're starting from false premise -- they produce a result that can (does) include all 8-bit values from 0 to 255. Just for example, one of the test vectors for SHA-256 is an input of ""abc"". The result from this (in hexadecimal) is:</p>

<p>Just within that test, the result includes bytes with values from 0x03 to 0xff.</p>

<p>For display, that may be (often is) rendered in something like hexadecimal. For transmission in email they're often encoded with something like MIME or UUENCODE. The hash itself, however, is not limited in this way.</p>

<p>Transforming the result this way makes no difference to collision resistance -- you still have 160/256/whatever bits of actual data, but the representation is expanded.</p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nothing.  If you create the same contents, you get the same SHA-1.</p>

<p>First, however, you need to realize that ""same contents"" of a commit means that—provided you don't get an accidental SHA-1 collision<sup>1</sup> or find a way to break SHA-1—you must create the same complete repository history leading up to and including the commit itself, including all the same trees, author-names, time-stamps, and so on.</p>

<p>This is because the contents of a commit <em>are</em> what you see if you run <code>git cat-file -p &lt;sha-1&gt;</code> on a commit (plus the tag-and-size field that says ""this object is of type commit"", so that there are no trivial ways to break things by creating a blob with the same contents as a previous commit).  Here's one as an example:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p 996b0fdbb4ff63bfd880b3901f054139c95611cf
tree e760f781f2c997fd1d26f2779ac00d42ca93f534

<p>Note that this string includes the tree and its SHA-1, both of this commit's parent SHA-1s, the author and timestamp, the committer and timestamp, and the message.  If you change even a <em>single bit</em> of this—such as by trying to change the underlying tree, or using some different parent commit(s)—you will get a new, different SHA-1, rather than <code>996b0fdbb4ff63bfd880b3901f054139c95611cf</code>.</p>

<p>So the answer to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So in theory if me and you do exactly the same steps at exactly the same time with exactly the same configured author, email etc, we would actually get the same commit SHA key?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is ""yes"".  However ... you must start with the same staging area (this is what will become the <code>tree</code>), and the same parent commits.  If you then configure your author, email, etc., exactly the same as the other guy, and both of you create a new commit at the same second (or using git's environment variables<sup>2</sup> to force the time stamps), you both get the same new commit.</p>

<p>Which is precisely what we want.  It doesn't matter if you create it, when you're named ""me"", or I create it, when I'm named ""me"", if all the rest of the contents are the same.  Because whoever creates it, the other ""me"" can clone it, and then we both have the same thing that way too.</p>

<p>(If I want to be sure that the ""me"" that creates something is not confused with the real me, I need to add something unique, that I know and the other me doesn't.  Of course, if I publish this thing somewhere, the other me know knows it.  But this is what signed, annotated tags are for.  They can contain a GPG signature.)</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>The chances of an accidental hash collision (for any pair of objects; chances rise with more objects) are 1 out of 2<sup>160</sup>, which is ... very small. :-)  The rise is actually very rapid, so that by the time you have a million objects, it's about 1 out of 2<sup>121</sup>.  The formula I use here is:</p>

<p>1 - exp(((-(<em>n</em> * (<em>n</em>-1))) / (2 * <em>r</em>))</p>

<p>where <em>r</em> = 2<sup>160</sup> and <em>n</em> is the number of objects.  Without the subtraction from 1, the equation calculates the ""safety margin"", as it were: the chance that we <em>won't</em> have an accidental hash collision.  If we want to keep this number in the same range as the safety margin that a disk drive won't read back the wrong contents for a file—or at least, that disk-makers claim—we need to keep it around 10<sup>-18</sup>, which means we need to avoid putting more than about 1.7 quadrillion (1.7E15) objects in our git databases.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>There are many git environment variables that you can set to override various defaults.  The ones for the author and committer, including date and email, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</li>
<li>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</li>
<li>GIT_AUTHOR_DATE</li>
<li>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</li>
<li>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</li>

","<p>For printing out hex values, you can use <code>std::hex</code> format; for setting width and fill character, use <code>std::setw</code> and <code>std::setfill</code>, which are part of <code>&lt;iomanip&gt;</code>.
As you do not show the data type of <code>c</code>, I suppose/suggest to use an unsigned integral type, e.g. <code>unsigned char</code>. I slightly adapted the code to make it self contained):</p>

<pre><code>#define SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH 256

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;

int main() {

    unsigned char c[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
    for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++)
        c[i]=i;

    std::stringstream ss;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++) {
        ss &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; std::setw(2) &lt;&lt; std::setfill('0') &lt;&lt; (unsigned int)c[i];
    }

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ss.str();
}

","<p>To resolve this issue you have to create a custom class that inherits SecurityAlgorithmSuite. You can then set the Default properties on the overrideable methods to whatever you need. To use it, instead of:   </p>

","<p>I do not know if it is possible to handle such a migration with Membership, without forcing users to go through a password reset process.</p>

At that point, you still have the login and password unhashed in memory, and you can then by the way convert the signature to the new format.</p>

"34928787","Migration from SHA1 to SHA2 ASP.net 4.5, C#","<p>We have one ASP.NET web application which is built in .NET Framework 4.5 version. Currently on production this application is using SHA1 encryption algorithm. This algorithm is set in ""MachineKey"" tag of application's web.config file. This application uses ASP.Net Membership concept for maintaining Login credentials.</p>

<p>As the SHA1 algorithm is on verge of degradation so we want to update our application from SHA1 to SHA2. For this we have set ""HMACSHA256"" in ""MachineKey"" tag of application's web.config file.</p>

<p>After upgrading our application to SHA2 with the above settings, we expect that the older user's passwords (which were encrypted using SHA1 and already present in membership database) will not work with SHA2 algorithm. But it allows older users to login without any modification in previously encrypted password.</p>

<p>Question 1: Are the changes made in ""MachineKey"" tag of application's web.config file enough/recommended for this migration?</p>

<p>Question 2: As we are still able to login into the application using previously encrypted passwords, does the membership database really uses the SHA2 encryption set in web.config file? Or we need to add some additional settings to enable SHA2 encryption on membership database level? Please advice.</p>

<p>Please suggest if there is any best way to enable SHA2 encryption on Membership database level.</p>
","<p>With my <a href=""/a/37221431/1178314"">other answer</a> technical details, I just realize why you can change hashing algorithm without causing old password to get ""lost"".</p>

<p>Membership does store the hashing algorithm it has used with each password, thus allowing it to still validates old password after a hash algorithm change.</p>

<p>This explains the behavior you have seen. To double check it (and infirms your question 1 &amp; 2 concerns), inspect your data in db, check the <code>PasswordFormat</code> column which should change depending on the used hash algorithm.</p>

<p>You should also check if simply logging in with an old account is enough to have it re-hashed to SHA-2 by Membership. If this is the case, all regular users will be re-hashed quickly after having done the change.</p>

"7071902","Small differences in SHA1 hashes","<p>A project I am working on uses Apache Shiro as a security framework. Passwords are SHA1 hashed (no salt, no iterations). Login is SSL secured. However, the remaining part of the application is not SSL secured. In this context (no SSL) there should be a form where a user can change the password.
Since it wouldn't be a good idea to transmit it plainly it should be hashed on the client and then transmitted to the server. As the client is GWT (2.3) based, I am trying this library <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gwt-crypto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/gwt-crypto</a>, which uses code from bouncycastle.
However, in many cases (not all) the hashes generated by both frameworks differ in 1-4(?) characters.
For instance ""happa3"" is hashed to</p>

<pre><code>""fe7f3cffd8a5f0512a5f1120f1369f48cd6f47c2""
</code></pre>

<p>by both implementations, whereas just ""happa"" is hashed to</p>

<pre><code>""fb3c3a741b4e07a87d9cb68f3db020d6fbfed00a""
</code></pre>

<p>by the Shiro implementation and to </p>

<pre><code>""fb3c3a741b4e07a87d9cb63f3db020d6fbfed00a""
</code></pre>

<p>by the gwt-crypto implementation (23rd character differs).
I wonder whether there is a ""correct""/standard SHA1 hashing and whether there is a bug in one of the libraries or maybe my usage of them is flawed.
One of my first thoughts was related to different encodings or strange conversions due to different transport mechanisms (RPC vs. Post). To my knowledge though (and what puzzles me most), SHA1 hashes should differ completely with a high probability if there is just a difference of a single bit. So different encodings shouldn't be the issue here.
I am using this code on the client (GWT) for hashing:</p>

<pre><code>String hashed = toHex(createSHA1Hash(""password""));
...
private String createSHA1Hash(String passwordString){
    SHA1Digest sha1 = new SHA1Digest();
    byte[] bytes;
    byte[] result = new byte[sha1.getDigestSize()];
    try {
        bytes = passwordString.getBytes();
        sha1.update(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
        int val = sha1.doFinal(result, 0);
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {}
    return new String(result);
}

public String toHex(String arg) {
    return new BigInteger(1, arg.getBytes()).toString(16);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this on the server (Shiro):</p>

<pre><code> String hashed = new Sha1Hash(""password"").toHex()
</code></pre>

<p>which afaics does something very similar behind the scenes (had a quick view on the source code).
Did I miss something obvious here?</p>

<p>EDIT: Seems like the GWT code does not run natively for some reason (i.e. just in development mode) and silently fails (it does compile, though). Have to find out why...</p>

<p>Edit(2): ""int val = sha1.doFinal(result, 0);"" is the line that makes trouble, i.e. if present, the whole code does not run natively (JS) but only in dev-mode (with wrong results)</p>

<p>Hash collisions happen when you have an algorithm that generates a hash of a specific size, regardless of the starting value.</p>

<p>A hash collision is when two different values, like ""mypassword"" and ""dsjakfuiUIs2kh-1jlks"" end up generating the <em>same</em> hash because of the mathematical operations performed on them.</p>

<p>You can't write code to prevent hash collisions, how often that happens is dependent on the hashing algorithm you are using.</p>

","<p>Just sha1() the entire file path, not only the file name. 
Filename xy.png can be only one in a directory, therefore your hash will be unique for that filename.
Also, this has the advantage that you will not have duplicate files (while with rand()/microtime() you can get same file 10 times in same dir, and if it's a 1GB file can cause problems)</p>

Probability of sha1 collision is negligible</p>

<p>And hash collision risk is not practical. No one has found sha1 collision till yet . So you are safe to use it. </p>

<p>Using a salt like microtime or random number may decreases the chances of probability but you simply can't avoid it.</p>

<p>And what you are using is sha1(string) whether string is a mixed value or single string.so using microtime and rand function wont affect anything to probability of hash collision.</p>

<p>Therefore there can be possibility that sha1(mixedvalue) collision might be equal or greater than collision of sha1(filename) so certainly that is of no use.</p>

<p>So dont worry and use this or simple way if you like to, it wont create problem in future, Thinking about hash collision is waste of time when the chances are very very very less.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>So, how do you decode the string once you get it encoded? </p>
","<p>I don't know what you mean by ""unpack"", but you can't get original string from the hash.</p>

<p>Let's understand the problem: you render some hidden fields and you want to make sure that they're submitted unchanged, right? Here's how you can ensure that.</p>

<p>Let's suppose you have two variables:</p>

<pre><code>first: foo
second: bar
</code></pre>

<p>You can hash them together with a secret key:</p>

<pre><code>secret_key = ""ysEJbKTuJU6u""
source_string = secret_key + ""first"" + ""foo"" + ""second"" + ""bar""
hash = MD5(source_string)

# =&gt; ""1adfda97d28af6535ef7e8fcb921d3f0""    
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can render your markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""first"" value=""foo"" /&gt;
&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""second"" value=""bar"" /&gt;
&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""hash"" value=""1adfda97d28af6535ef7e8fcb921d3f0""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Upon form submission, you get values of <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> fields, concat them to your secret key in a similar manner and hash again.</p>

<p>If hashes are equal, your values haven't been changed.</p>

<p>Note: <strong>never</strong> render secret key to the client. And sort key/value pairs before hashing (to eliminate dependency on order).</p>

<p>( <em>disclaimer: I am not a crypto person, so you may just stop reading now</em>)</p>

<p>As for performance/security, even though MD5 was found to have a weakness, it's still pretty usable, IMHO. SHA1 has a theoretical weakness, although no successful attack has been made yet. There are no known weaknesses in SHA-256.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>So, how do you decode the string once you get it encoded? </p>
","<p>For this application, any of the encryption algorithms is fine. You can pack the values any way you want, so long as it's repeatable. One common method is to pack the fields into a string the same way you would encode them into a URL for a GET request (name=value).</p>

<p>To compute the hash, create a text secret that can be whatever you want. It should be at least 12 bytes long though. Compute the hash of the secret concatenated with the packed fields and append that onto the end.</p>

<p>So, say you picked MD5, a secret of <code>JS90320ERHe2</code> and you have these fields:</p>

<pre><code>first_name = Jack
last_name = Smith
other_field = 7=2
</code></pre>

<p>First, URL encode it:</p>

<pre><code>first_name=Jack&amp;last_name=Smith&amp;other_field=7%3d=2
</code></pre>

<p>Then compute the MD5 hash of</p>

<pre><code>JS90320ERHe2first_name=Jack&amp;last_name=Smith&amp;other_field=7%3d=2
</code></pre>

<p>Which is <code>6d0fa69703935efaa183be57f81d38ea</code>. The final encoded field is:</p>

<pre><code>first_name=Jack&amp;last_name=Smith&amp;other_field=7%3d=2&amp;hash=6d0fa69703935efaa183be57f81d38ea
</code></pre>

<p>So that's what you pass to the user. To validate it, remove the hash from the end, compute the MD5 hash by concatenating what's left with the secret, and if the hashes match, the field hasn't been tampered with.</p>

<p>Nobody can compute their own valid MD5 because they don't know to prefix the string with.</p>

<p>Note that an adversary can re-use any old valid value set. They just can't create their own value set from scratch or modify an existing one and have it test valid. So make sure you include something in the information so you can verify that it is suitable for the purpose it has been used.</p>

","<p>What you really need is not a plain hash function, but a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">message authentication code</a> such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HMAC</a>.  Since you say you'd like to use SHA-256, you might like HMAC_SHA256, which is available in Perl via the <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/Digest/SHA.html#SYNOPSIS-%28HMAC-SHA%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Digest::SHA</a> module:</p>

<pre><code>use Digest::SHA qw(hmac_sha256_base64);

my $mac = hmac_sha256_base64( $string, $key );
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>$key</code> is an arbitrary key, which you should keep secret, and <code>$string</code> contains the data you want to sign.  To apply this to a more complex data structure (such as a hash of key&ndash;value pairs), you first need to convert it to a string.  There are several ways to do that; for example, you could use <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/Storable.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Storable</a>:</p>

<pre><code>use Storable qw(freeze);

sub pairs_to_string {
    local $Storable::canonical = 1;
    my %hash = @_;
    return freeze( \%hash );
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could also URL-encoding, as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/8830520"">suggested by David Schwartz</a>.  The important thing is that, whatever method you use, it should always return the exact same string when given the same hash as input.</p>

<p>Then, before sending the data to the user, you calculate a MAC for them and include it as an extra field in the data.  When you receive the data back, you remove the MAC field (and save its value), recalculate the MAC for the remaining fields and compare it to the value you received.  If they don't match, someone (or something) has tampered with the data.  Like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $key = ""secret"";
sub mac { hmac_sha256_base64( pairs_to_string(@_), $key ) }

# before sending data to client:
my %data = (foo =&gt; ""something"", bar =&gt; ""whatever"");
$data{mac} = mac( %data );

# after receiving %data back from client:
my $mac = delete $data{mac};
die ""MAC mismatch"" if $mac ne mac( %data );
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there are some potential tricks this technique doesn't automatically prevent, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replay attacks</a>: once you send the data and MAC to the user, they'll learn the MAC corresponding to the particular set of data, and could potentially replace the fields in a later form with values saved from an earlier form.  To protect yourself against such attacks, you should include enough identifying information in the data protected by the MAC to ensure that you can detect any potentially harmful replays.  Ideally, you'd want to include a unique ID in every form and check that no ID is ever submitted twice, but that may not always be practical.  Failing that, it may be a good idea to include a user ID (so that a malicious user can't trick someone else into submitting their data) and a form ID (so that a user can't copy data from one form to another) and perhaps a timestamp and/or a session ID (so that you can reject old data) in the form (and in the MAC calculation).</p>

What you need to do in case of passwords is you hash the user input and compare it with the hash of the password to check if it was the original password. To know how you convert the password into a SHA-256 hash read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5531455/how-to-encode-some-string-with-sha256-in-java"">this</a>.</p>

<p>Probably hash your new passwords with MD5 and then hash the MD5 with your password hashing library. That way, you can maintain backwards compatibility with your old passwords.</p>

<p>I.e. password_hash(All old, md5'd passwords) and password_hash( md5(New passwords) )</p>

","<p>If you hash with MD5 first, you will only have the spread of MD5 (128 bit). A large fraction of the space of SHA512 will not be covered by your passwords. So you don't take advantage of SHA512, but it won't be worse than MD5. </p>

<p>You have the benefit that if someone obtains the SHA512 hash and doesn't know the salt (this you have to enforce somehow) can't look up the hashes and get the passwords -- something that would be possible with the MD5 database you have now.</p>

<p>So yes, you can just rehash the existing MD5 passwords. But as explained in the first paragraph, it would be a bad idea to apply MD5 to all new passwords as well and then hash them as SH512. A easy implementation would be to have a boolean 'salted' field in the database next to the hashes (but don't put the salt there).</p>

","<p>If you look at how most Bank and high security people does there password changing. Most of them basically ask people who is using the old encryption method to create a new password. I think you first solution of placing a flag on all existing old MD5 password users, and notify them they need to create new password and slowly migrate them to the new system. That way when you trouble shoot the system if anything goes wrong you won't be asking is this a new user or an old one. Are we double hashing or single? Should never compare two hash as a possible answer because what if MD5('abc') => 123, SHA('NO') => 123, that means someone could have typed in the wrong password but still gets in.</p>

"26622185","SHA1() vs shasum from command line","<p>So I have been playing around with SHA hashing, but I have run up against a bit of a wall. For some reason, shasum from the command line and SHA1() from openssl in my program produce two difference results. </p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/sha.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
  int i;
  char data[] = ""README"";
  size_t length = sizeof(data);
  unsigned char hash[50];

  SHA1(data, length, hash);

  printf(""shasum of \""README\"" is \n"");
  for(i = 0; i&lt;SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++){
    printf(""%x"", hash[i]);
  }
  printf(""\n"");

  /*Using shasum utility*/

  int rc = fork();
  if(rc &lt; 0){
    fprintf(stderr, ""Fork failed. \n"");
    exit(1);
  }
  else if(rc == 0){
    char* myargs[3];
    myargs[0] = strdup(""shasum"");
    myargs[1] = strdup(""README"");
    myargs[2] = NULL;
    execvp(myargs[0], myargs);
  }
  wait(NULL);

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>shasum of ""README"" is
aabc5996b4a0256158cbaa6eb4e01b3aa992d942
827cc372e1a3c99b66f6ad820b223939c68bd389  README
</code></pre>

<p>The first hash is from SHA1 and the second hash is from shasum (fork/exec from within program). What is causing this?</p>
","<p>The problem is that the command-line function ""shasum"" takes as an argument a filename, whereas the openssl-library C-function ""shasum"" takes as an argument the actual data. </p>

<p>That is, you are comparing the result of the hash of the file named README to the result of the hash of the string ""README"".</p>

<p>To see both of calculations result the same, just change:</p>

<pre><code>SHA1(data, length, hash);
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>SHA1(data, length-1, hash);
</code></pre>

<p>As Jonathan Leffler said, this is to correct the fact that you're including the terminating '\0'.</p>

<p>For the other calculation, you could do <code>echo -n README | shasum</code> to see the real hash. Or, to see it result ok in your program, just output it to a file named README: <code>echo -n README &gt; README</code>.</p>

<p>Your program will then output:</p>

<pre><code>shasum of ""README"" is 
69e27356ef629022720d868ab0c0e3394775b6c1
69e27356ef629022720d868ab0c0e3394775b6c1  README
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If you want to use the SHA1 function to calculate the hash of the readme file, you would have to read the file (see You would need to programatically read the file to a char* buffer, ( see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3747086/reading-the-whole-text-file-into-a-char-array-in-c"">Reading the whole text file into a char array in C</a>) and pass this buffer to the SHA1 function.</p>

"23949502","Wordpress sha 256 login","<p>I've been asked to enable SHA256 for storing wordpress passwords.
I've searched for plugins with no luck (not working), so I started to develop my own.</p>

<p>I first thoug.. well if I replace the wp_hash_password with my own function, It would encrypt when saving password and loging. But I wasn't that lucky. I'm able to run hash(sha256) though in a basic php file. I'm aware that users wont' be able to login as the stored key would be md5 and the comparation would be SHA, but it isn't a problem. </p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code> if(!function_exists('wp_hash_password')):
   function wp_hash_password($password){
     return hash('sha256', $password);
   }
endif;
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess I'll have to make my own ""check login"" function.
Did someone did something like this?¿</p>
","<p>Seems to me that your approach should work if you override the <code>wp_check_password</code> function as well.  That'll have to be done in a plugin, I think, as the functions are loaded before the theme's <code>functions.php</code>.  Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
Plugin Name: sh256pass
Version: 1.0
*/

if(!function_exists('wp_hash_password')):
   function wp_hash_password($password){
     return hash('sha256', $password);
   }
endif;


if(!function_exists('wp_check_password')):
    function wp_check_password($password, $hash, $user_id = '') {
        // You might want to apply the check_password filter here 
        return wp_hash_password($password) == $hash;
    }
endif;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you'll either have to have your users reset their password on their next login (you won't be able to convert the existing passwords automatically), or you'll have to follow WordPress's approach in <a href=""https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.9.1/src/wp-includes/pluggable.php#L1861"" rel=""nofollow""><code>wp_check_password</code></a> and compare the password to the old encrypted value (in their case <code>md5</code>), and if that matches, update to the new value.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the <code>wp_users.user_pass</code> field is only 64 characters long.  While that's (just) long enough to store the <code>sha256</code> value, it isn't long enough to store the <code>sha256</code> value <em>and</em> a salt.  If you don't salt, and two users choose the same password, the <code>wp_users.user_pass</code> field will contain the same value, making it obvious to anyone with access to the database that the passwords are the same.  My gut feel is that that is a greater security risk than using the current algorithm.  You might be able to get around that by (say) concatenating the user ID and the password before hashing, but there might be edge cases where you don't know the user ID (such as when a user is created).</p>

<p>Personally, I'd question the requirement.</p>

","<p>I think you convert <code>byte[]</code> to <code>String</code> in wrong way, it should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>hash = new String(data);
</code></pre>

<p>Also you are doing the comparison wrong, should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(result2.equals(hash))
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion you should not convert <code>byte[]</code> to <code>String</code> at all. Use <code>Arrays.equals(byteArray1,byteArray2);</code>. Your data is random bits of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>s. Converting it to <code>String</code> can be done in many ways, but it doesn't make any sense.</p>

<ul>
<li>public_key is a path to public.key</li>
<li>PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY succeeds</li>
<li>NID_sha256 is what I think I should use for the verification</li>
<li>file is a byte array with the contents of permissions</li>
<li>file_size is the array size of file</li>
<li>sign is a byte array with the contents of permissions.sign</li>
<li>sign_size is the array size of sign</li>
<li>RSA_verify() fails, it returns a 0</li>
</ul>

<p>So the question is, is it correct to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>generate the keys with the commands I used,</p></li>
<li><p>sign the permissions file (which generates permissions.sign),</p></li>
<li><p>and then try to verify the files with PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY() and RSA_verify() ?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are the commands I used for the signing process equivalent to the C functions I used for the verification process?</p>

<p>Please let me know if more info is required or where I could study more about this.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I added some error printing after calling RSA_Verify():</p>

<p>ANDROID_LOGE_P(""openssl: %s"", ERR_reason_error_string(ERR_get_error()));</p>

<p>It prints:</p>

<p>openssl: bad signature</p>

<p>Still investigating.</p>
","<p>There were several missing steps in my reading process for the public key.</p>

<p>The correct commands to generate the private and public keys are as follows:</p>

<p>Generate a private key
 ""openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048""</p>

<p>Extract the public key (DER certificate form) from the private key (needed by RSA_SHA_Verify())
 ""openssl req -outform DER -new -x509 -key private.key -out public.key -days 30000""</p>

<p>Generate a public key with no certificate info (only needed by ""openssl dgst -sha1 -verify ..."")
 ""openssl x509 -inform DER -in public.key -pubkey -noout > public_no_cert.key""</p>

<p>Sign a file with the private key
 ""openssl dgst -sha1 -sign private.key -out permissions.sign permissions""</p>

<p>Verify a file with the public key (no certificate info)
 ""openssl dgst -sha1 -verify public_no_cert.key -signature permissions.sign permissions""</p>

<p>Please refer to the documentation on OpenSSL.org for details. I required a X509 DER certificate that was holding the public key to verify the signed SHA with RSA_verify().</p>

<p>An equivalency in command mode to RSA_verify() is:</p>

<p>openssl dgst -sha1 -verify public.key -signature permissions.sign permissions</p>

<p>For code source, please refer to this link:
<a href=""http://www.bmt-online.org/geekisms/RSA_verify"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmt-online.org/geekisms/RSA_verify</a></p>

<p>It does NOT compile at first sight, you have to tweak it. Call the functions in there as follows:</p>

<pre><code>   result = sign_data(
         input_file_buffer,
         input_file_size,
         private_key_buffer,
         private_key_size,
         (void**)&amp;signature,
         &amp;signature_size);

   result = verify_data(
         input_file_buffer,
         input_file_size,
         signature_buffer,
         signature_size,
         public_key_buffer,
         public_key_size);
</code></pre>

<p>Everything has to be in RAM, pass them as pointers.</p>

<p>The signing function expects the pointer to a pointer (**) to save the signed SHA into it. You can later save it into a file.</p>

<p>Tested under Ubuntu openssl 0.9.8k.</p>

","<p>First, I would <strong>STRONGLY</strong> advice against using MySQL's <code>sha()</code> or PHP's <code>sha1()</code> alone for password hashing purposes. <strong>This is a huge security risk for your users if your database gets compromised.</strong></p>

<p>Please take the time to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6340105/how-can-we-create-a-fairly-secure-password-hash-in-php/6340197#6340197"">read my previous answer on the subject of password hashing</a> to properly secure your data.</p>

<hr>

<p>Second, your code is vulnerable to an <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/601300/what-is-sql-injection/601524#601524""><strong>SQL Injection attack</strong></a>. Use <a href=""http://php.net/mysql_real_escape_string"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code></a> to escape the variables you are going to put in your query before-hand.</p>

<pre><code>$query2 = ""insert into company(username,password)
  values('"" . mysql_real_escape_string($username) .
          ""', sha1('"" . mysql_real_escape_string($password) . ""'))"";
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Third, your <code>$password</code> variable is being overwritten by your <code>databaseconnection.php</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>include(""databaseconnection.php"");
$databaseconnect = connect($host,$user, $password ,$database);
</code></pre>

<p>To put emphasis...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$databaseconnect = connect($host,$user,</code><strong><code>$password</code></strong><code>,$database);</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the <code>$password</code> used later on in your query still contains the password for the database connection, not your user's password.</p>

<p>Change the name of your variable in <code>databaseconnection.php</code> or even better still, use an array to hold all the configuration.</p>

<pre><code>$dbConnectParams = array('host' =&gt; 'localhost'
                         'user' =&gt; 'myUser',
                         'pass' =&gt; 'myPassword',
                         'db' =&gt; 'myDB');
</code></pre>

<p>Then, change your code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>include(""databaseconnection.php"");
$databaseconnect = mysql_connect($dbConnectParams['host'],
                           $dbConnectParams['user'],
                           $dbConnectParams['pass'],
                           $dbConnectParams['db']);
</code></pre>

<p>Since you are already passing the database when calling <code>mysql_connect()</code>, you do no need to call <code>mysql_select_db()</code>.</p>

<p>SHA is designed to be secure -- not by hoping that the cracker has a slow enough machine -- but by mathematical proof. If and when the number of irreversible bits in each round is increased and permuted to the 256 bit hash code, there will never be enough computer power to try all possible sequences that generate that particular hash code. Not even enough energy in the universe to wrap a 256-bit counter. </p>

","<p>There are currently three key-derivation functions widely considered to be secure against brute force cracking attempts.  Key-derivation functions are slightly different from regular hashing algorithms in that they are <em>designed</em> to be slow, even in the face of modern GPU-based computation.</p>

<p>I'll list them in order of <em>theoretical</em> security:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"" rel=""noreferrer"">PBKDF2</a> is designed by RSA, based on SHA, and is the algorithm recommended by NIST.  There's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#PBKDF2"" rel=""noreferrer"">a couple</a> <a href=""http://anandam.name/pbkdf2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">implementations</a> that you could use in a browser.</p>

<p><em>Note to Node users:</em> Node's <code>crypto</code> module has a <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_pbkdf2_password_salt_iterations_keylen_callback"" rel=""noreferrer"">built-in PBKDF2 function</a>.  Use that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""noreferrer"">bcrypt</a>, based on Blowfish, is slightly more secure than PBKDF2.  It has been relatively well-tested and verified secure, but does not have a stamp of approval from any standards bodies, if that's a consideration for you.  There's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/javascript-bcrypt/"" rel=""noreferrer"">a generic JS implementation here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note to Node users:</em> Use <a href=""https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/"" rel=""noreferrer"">node.bcrypt</a>, which performs the computationally expensive stuff on a separate thread.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt"" rel=""noreferrer"">scrypt</a> is far and away the most theoretically secure (slowest) KDF.  Unfortunately, the algorithm is very new, so it has not been validated by rigorous study and testing by the cryptographic community.  It is, however, <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-josefsson-scrypt-kdf-00"" rel=""noreferrer"">on track to become a IETF standard</a>.</p>

<p>Because the algorithm is so new, it is hard to find implementations.  I could only find <a href=""https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt-js"" rel=""noreferrer"">this half-baked one</a>.  While the security benefits are very promising, I would not recommend scrypt until both the algorithm itself and its implementations are verified secure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How do these three actually compare?  The <a href=""http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">scrypt paper</a> has a comparison:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SMN3.png"" alt=""algorithm comparison table""></p>

","<p>Simple answer, you can't. That is if you want to support all browsers at least. I think both Chrome and FireFox supports the reading of files on the client, and IE supports it with the help of ActiveX controls, but to get a solution that works in all browsers you have to use a plugin like Flash or Silverlight. Also, when doing file-uploads of video-magnitude (large+ files), I think going for flash or the likes from the start is a good idea anyhow, but that's just my opinion.</p>

<p>However, there <em>is</em> a size difference between storing the hash as a string (this will take at least 40 bytes, depending on the string encoding) and storing it as binary data (this will take 20 bytes).</p>

","<p>Is 20 bytes per hash(assuming binary storage) really too much? If you currently use hex encoding switching to binary saves you 20 bytes per hash. Base64 saves about 10 bytes compared to hex.</p>

<p>With PostgreSQL 10, you can set <code>password_encryption</code> to <code>scram-sha-256</code>. From <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/runtime-config-connection.html#guc-password-encryption"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the docs</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a password is specified in <code>CREATE ROLE</code> or <code>ALTER ROLE</code> without writing either <code>ENCRYPTED</code> or <code>UNENCRYPTED</code>, this parameter determines whether the password is to be encrypted. The default value is md5, which stores the password as an MD5 hash. Setting this to plain stores it in plaintext. on and off are also accepted, as aliases for md5 and plain, respectively. <strong>Setting this parameter to scram-sha-256 will encrypt the password with SCRAM-SHA-256.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>append the bit '1' to the message </p>
  
  <p>append k bits '0', where k is the minimum number >= 0 such that the resulting message
      length (modulo 512 in bits) is 448. </p>
  
  <p>append length of message (without the '1' bit or padding), in bits, as 64-bit big-endian
  integer

</blockquote>

<p>So if my message is <code>01100001 01100010 01100011</code> I would first add a <code>1</code> to get</p>

<p><code>01100001 01100010 01100011 1</code> </p>

<p>Then you would fill in <code>0</code>s so that the total length is 448 mod 512:</p>

<p><code>01100001 01100010 01100011 10000000 0000 ... 0000</code> </p>

<p>(So in this example, one would add 448 - 25 <code>0</code>s)</p>

<p>My question is: What does the last part mean? I would like to see an example.</p>
","<p>It means the message length, padded to 64 bits, with the bytes appearing in order of significance. So if the message length is 37113, that's 90 f9 in hex; two bytes. There are two basic(*) ways to represent this as a 64-bit integer,</p>

<pre><code>00 00 00 00 00 00 90 f9  # big endian
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>f9 90 00 00 00 00 00 00  # little endian
</code></pre>

<p>The former convention follows the way numbers are usually written out in decimal: one hundred and two is written 102, with the most significant part (the ""big end"") being written first, the least significant (""little end"") last. The reason that this is specified explicitly is that both conventions are used in practice; internet protocols use big endian, Intel-compatible processors use little endian, so if they were decimal machines, they'd write one hundred and two as 201.</p>

<p>(*) Actually there are 8! = 40320 ways to represent a 64-bit integer if 8-bit bytes are the smallest units to be permuted, but two are in actual use.</p>

","<p>It would be helpful if you posted your results that led you to conclude that you're not getting an appropriate distribution, but it's likely one of three things is going on here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You're simply looking at too small of a sample, and/or you're miss-interpreting your data.  As others have commented, it's completely reasonable for a uniform distribution to not have perfectly uniform output.</p></li>
<li><p>You'd see better results if you used <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>mt_rand</code></a> instead of <code>rand</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(Personally, I think this is most likely) You're over-optimizing your seed generation, and losing data / pigeon holing / otherwise hurting your ability to generate random numbers.  Reading your code, I think you're doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a uniform random hash of an unknown value</li>
<li>Split the hash into longs and bitwise XOR-ing them together</li>
<li>Setting <code>rand</code>'s seed, and generating a random number off that seed</li>
</ol>

<p>But why are you doing step 2?  What benefit do you think you're getting from that?  Try taking that step out, and just use the first value you extract from the hash as your seed, and see if that doesn't give you better results.  Good rule of thumb with randomness - don't try to outsmart the people who implemented the algorithms, it can't be done :)</p></li>

<p>PHP crypt has a salt and a number of rounds. E.g. for 5000 rounds and salt of ""usesomesillystringforsalt"" it would be;</p>

<p><code>
<code>$hash = crypt('Clear Text String', '$5$rounds=5000$usesomesillystringforsalt$');</code>
</code></p>

<p>I hope im not blind, but i cant find how to reproduce this behaviour in crypto-js. Its syntax doesn't seem to allow for rounds or salt.</p>

<p>Is it possible or should i just resort to using the basic <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP hash</a> instead of crypt? </p>
","<p>The CryptoJS API doesn't provide a way to specify a salt or the number of rounds for SHA256. You could add a salt manually if necessary, and specifying rounds doesn't make sense since ""plain"" SHA256 always uses a fixed number of rounds (64).</p>

<p>The number of rounds in PHP's <code>crypt()</code> actually defines how often the SHA256 algorithm is applied consecutively, in order to increase the complexity of brute force attacks. The <a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/standard/crypt_sha256.c"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP source code</a> comments on this as follows: <em>""Repeatedly run the collected hash value through SHA256 to burn CPU cycles""</em>.</p>

<p>As you can see in the source code (<a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/standard/crypt.c"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/standard/crypt_sha256.c"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), <code>crypt()</code> is actually a key derivation function that only makes use of SHA256 to generate cryptographically secure, salted hashes. So it also doesn't simply append the given salt to the key, instead it's a more elaborate process.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, it is not possible to get the same results with the algorithms provided by CryptoJS.</strong></p>

<p><code>crypt()</code> is mainly intended for password hashing. So if you need the hashes for another purpose, <code>hash()</code> is a good alternative (and of course creates exactly the same results as <code>CryptoJS.SHA256()</code>).</p>

<p>However, bear in mind that any cryptography with JavaScript is generally <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/"" rel=""nofollow"">considered harmful</a>. Hence, you should better use SSL in your application, if possible, and generate the hashes server side. If this is an option, have a look at <a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">bcrypt</a>.</p>

They are C source files, and provide the compress function for SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256. The intrinsic based implementations increase throughput approximately 3x to 4x for SHA-1, and approximately 6x to 12x for SHA-224 and SHA-256.</p>

","<p>First of all, it is unlikely that you can compress a good hash in the normal sense.  Compression is about a reversible encoding that reduces redundancy.  In a good hash there should be no redundancy to reduce, and hence compression will be ineffective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since SHA-256 is 32 bytes long (256 bits), and I need it to fit into the serialVersionUID (64 bits), how might I convert it to a 64 bit value and minimize the loss of the characteristics of a good hash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what are those good characteristics?  Well the primary characteristic of a good hash is that it is impractical to reverse it; i.e. it is impractical to work out a possible input that resulted in the hash.  And a related characteristic is that given a known input that produces a given hash, it is impractical to produce another input (i.e. a collision) that gives the same hash.</p>

<p>Now when you go from a 256 bit to a 64 bit hash, you make it <em>a whole lot easier</em> to reverse a hash or produce a collision for a hash ... by brute-force.  Basically, an 64 bit hash means there is one chance in <code>2^64</code> that any random input will have a given hash.   That probability is large enough that some ""bad guy"" with enough cores has a good enough chance of success (in a reasonable time) to make brute-force a reasonable option.</p>

<p>But does it really matter?  What would someone achieve by creating a serialVersion String that collides?  These strings are not secret, and they don't tell you anything definitive about the API of the object ...</p>

<p>The bottom line is that if these reduced hashes are being used as serialVersion strings are designed to be used, then there won't be any problem in (for example) just using the first 64 bits of the SHA-256 hash.  There is no need to XOR or checksum or do any other more complicated transformation.</p>

","<p><code>Array.Sort()</code> accepts either an <code>IComparer&lt;T&gt;</code> interface implementation or a <code>Comparison&lt;T&gt;</code> delegate.  In either case, as noted by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/15622/paolo-tedesco"">Paolo Tedesco</a>, you must write a function that accepts two byte arrays and returns a numeric comparison result.</p>

<p>Here is a succinct implementation that efficiently does this:</p>

<pre><code>int CompareByteArrays(byte[] a, byte[] b)
{
    var length = Math.Min(a.Length, b.Length);
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
    {
        var diff = a[i] - b[i];
        if (diff != 0)
            return diff;
    }
    return a.Length - b.Length;

","<p>I stumbled upon this question which is quite old but very close to what I'm attempting to do nowadays, that's why I would like to contribute to this thread. I'm trying to sort a <code>List&lt;Byte[]&gt;</code>, whose values are the basically hashes and this is what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>[SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity]
internal static class NativeMethods
{
    [DllImport(""MSVCRT.dll"", CallingConvention=CallingConvention.Cdecl, ExactSpelling=true)]
    private static extern Int32 memcmp([In] IntPtr pointer1, [In] IntPtr pointer2, [In] UIntPtr count);

    internal static Int32 CompareSequences(Byte[] array1, Byte[] array2)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(array1, array2))
            return 0;

        if (array1 == null)
            return 1;

        if (array2 == null)
            return -1;

        if (array1.Length != array2.Length)
            return -Math.Min(Math.Max(array1.Length - array2.Length, -1), 1);

        unsafe
        {
            fixed (Byte* pointer1 = array1, pointer2 = array2)
                return -Math.Min(Math.Max(memcmp((IntPtr)pointer1, (IntPtr)pointer2, (UIntPtr)array1.Length), -1), 1);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Byte[]&gt; hashes = ComputeHashes();
hashes.Sort(NativeMethods.CompareSequences);
</code></pre>

<p>This is what it does:</p>

<ol>
<li>Null arrays are placed at the bottom of the list.</li>
<li>Non-null arrays are sorted by length, then by ""content"":

<ul>
<li>In presence of mismatching lengths, bigger arrays prevail.</li>
<li>In presence of identical lengths, the array whose first mismatching byte is greater prevails.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Since you are working with hashes, there should be no null values and all the arrays in your list are supposed to have the same length. Hence, the comparison function could be simplified as follows:</p>

<pre><code>internal static Int32 CompareSequences(Byte[] array1, Byte[] array2)
{
    unsafe
    {
        fixed (Byte* pointer1 = array1, pointer2 = array2)
            return -Math.Min(Math.Max(memcmp((IntPtr)pointer1, (IntPtr)pointer2, (UIntPtr)array1.Length), -1), 1);
    }
}

"24941614","Multi-user ""provably fair""","<p>""Provably fair"" is an algorithm which allows players of online gambling sites (mostly BTC) to ensure they're always getting a fair shake. You can read more in depth about ""provably fair"" on almost all BTC gambling sites including <a href=""https://bitzino.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitzino.com/</a> or <a href=""https://primedice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://primedice.com/</a>.</p>

<p>The algorithm goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a random ""secret seed"" to be used for the next 24 hours</li>
<li>Before each bet generate and disclose to the player a ""server seed""</li>
<li>The player then generates a ""client seed"" and places his bet</li>
<li>The server then SHA-2 hashes secret_seed+server_seed+client_seed</li>
<li>The digital signature is then used to determine the outcome of the bet</li>
</ol>

<p>Some variations forgo altogether the ""secret seed"" in favor of simply hashing the server seed and disclosing only its hash to the player.</p>

<p>While both variations work well, I have taken an interest in creating a ""multi-user"" experience. As it stands, provably fair only works individually. What I would like is a way for two users to both bet on the outcome of a single event. </p>

<p>For example, if the game is Roulette, I want all users who bet on black for that particular bet to all win, and all those who bet on red to all lose etc.</p>

<p>The naive approach is to have each user contribute a part of the client seed. But this would allow a super-user among the legitimate players to manipulate things. As he would know in advance the outcome of any given client seed he could ensure his piece was contributed last and in such a way as to maximize the house's profit.</p>

<p>Another approach is for the server to generate the outcome, hash it and then disclose this hash to the players before any bets are placed. This forgoes entirely the need for a client seed and would ensure the outcome is not tampered with but would allow the server to manipulate outcomes based on the game (for example, picking 0 or 00 in Roulette) or in easily observed betting patterns. For example, even if the game was something like >50 or &lt;50 on a 1-100 die (where there exists no clear motivation for one outcome over the other) if we see a player betting 1,2,4,8... on "">50"" we can be pretty sure his next bet is going to be 16 on "">50"" and can manipulate things in our favor.</p>

<p>Has something like this ever been implemented before? How might you approach this problem? Is it even possible?</p>

<p>which is about 100k / sec, for me it is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I am using physical device (LG P990, 2.2.2). Can I get better results with Java, or I have to look into JNI implementation?</p>

<p>I have played with buffer size - no significant difference.</p>

<h1>Traceview results</h1>

<p>So it seems the bottleneck is in updating hash.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tixqc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h1>Research</h1>

<p>That is interesting. When I have tried on 2.3.2 (SE Xperia), processing speed was about 12meg/sec. When I've tried on 2.2 (HTC Legend), the speed was even slower than at first device. Could it be so that something has been changed since 2.3?</p>
","<p>According to my benchmarks, that code should easily be able to perform way better than 120 kb/s (I'm running on different hardware, but still).</p>

<p>If you profile the code with <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debugging/debugging-tracing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Traceview</a>, where is the time spent? If the bottleneck is FileInputStream.read(), think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>if some other app is using the sdcard at the same time as you, like a media indexing app or something. Sharing bandwidth with some other app will have an adverse effect on the sdcard reading performance of your app.</li>
<li>If the sdcard itself is the problem. Try another sdcard or re-format the one you have.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the bottleneck is MessageDigest.update() (which I doubt), I guess you do need to look into a JNI solution. For your information, the SHA-1 implementation already is in native code (see <a href=""https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/21e6e2de1f0062f949fcc52d0b4559dfa3246e0e/core/jni/android_message_digest_sha1.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">android_message_digest_sha1.cpp</a>), but maybe you can gain a speedup by avoiding some native &lt;-> Java copying.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1 (Please ignore):</strong></p>

<p>(Based on your profiling, the problem seems to be that you don't use Android's optimized <code>android.security.MessageDigest</code> but instead <code>java.security.MessageDigest</code>. Try <code>android.security.MessageDigest</code> instead. Both Android 2.2 and 2.3 have native SHA-1 implementations of <code>android.security.MessageDigest</code>.)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Sorry, I forgot about <code>android.security.MessageDigest</code> being internal. I now realize that I was also using <code>java.security.MessageDigest</code> in my benchmarking. I was running on Android 2.3 though, and it turns out the SHA-1 implementation of <code>java.security.MessageDigest</code> in Android 2.3 is in native code as well, while that appearently is not the case on Android 2.2.</p>

<p>So the answer to your original question is: Yes, it is painfully slow in Android 2.2 due to a Java implementation but significantly faster in Android 2.3 due to an implementation in native code. You should see similar speedups on Android 2.2 if you use your own SHA-1 implementation in native code.</p>

","<p>Are you sure this is not intended behaviour? Does it return the same hash if you pass the same value? IF yes, then you've achieved your purpose. You've got a one way hashed string of the username and password.</p>

<p>comparing
so you retrieve the has from database and store the hash from the table</p>

<p>get the userid and password from database and compute the hash</p>

<p>So basically, when the user types in his username, you fetch his userid from database
Calculate the has from the provided password 
and you've got the two hashes.</p>

<pre><code>databasehash=gethashfromdatabase(user_id)
receviedhash=computehash(user_id,password)
</code></pre>

<p>now, you can compare the two.</p>

","<p>When you deal with strong encryption, strong hashes (such as SHA1) it is critical that you understand that all of them are defined to work on strings of octets, which are usually arrays of unsigned characters. They are not ""strings"" as used by popular programming languages.</p>

<p>What you are seeing, ""5C6BED..."" is simply a hexadecimal encoding of the octets. Just call that a string, and store it, and then retrieve it, and convert back to the raw value for processing.</p>

<p>But is there a way to pass to it a file stream when the file is for example 10GB in size ?</p>
","<p>That exact code can't take a stream, no.</p>

<p>Look at the loop <code>while (currentBlock &lt;= endOfFullBlocks)</code>. It runs 64 bytes at a time through the actual hashing code. So in order to modify this code to take a stream, you need it to read those 64 bytes from the stream rather than taking them from <code>sarray</code> (which points to the same data as the input <code>src</code>).</p>

<p>64 bytes per read is <em>not</em> an efficient way to read 10GB of data, so actually you might like to introduce a second loop: one to read larger chunks from the file and one to put 64 byte blocks of that through the hash.</p>

<p>You will of course also need to modify the code to handle the ""leftover"" part of the input data that's not a multiple of 64.</p>

<p>Alternatively, find a different SHA1 implementation with ""init"", ""update"", ""finish""/""digest"" functions, and use that instead. The idea of such interfaces is that you call ""update"" as many times as you like, passing in chunks of data of whatever size is convenient for reading your stream.</p>

","<p>If at all possible, pull something off the shelf. You do not want to roll your own SHA-256 implementation because to get official blessing, you would have to have it certified.</p>

<p>That said, the specification is</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>5.1.1 SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256</h3>
  
  <p>Suppose that the length of the message, <em>M</em>, is <em>l</em> bits. Append the bit <code>1</code> to the end of the message, followed by <em>k</em> zero bits, where <em>k</em> is the smallest, non-negative solution to the equation</p>
  
  <p><em>l</em> + 1 + <em>k</em> &equiv; 448 mod 512</p>
  
  <p>Then append the 64-bit block that is equal to the number <em>l</em> expressed using a binary representation. For example, the (8-bit ASCII) message “<strong>abc</strong>” has length 8 × 3 = 24, so the message is padded with a one bit, then 448 - (24 + 1) = 423 zero bits, and then the message length, to become the 512-bit padded message</p>

<pre><code>                                  423       64
                                 .-^-.  .---^---.
01100001  01100010  01100011  1  00…00  00…011000
   “a”       “b”       “c”                  '-v-'
                                             l=24
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Then length of the padded message should now be a multiple of 512 bits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might be tempted to use <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/vec.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>vec</code></a> because it allows you to address single bits, but you would have to work around funky addressing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If bits is 4 or less, the string is broken into bytes, then the bits of each byte are broken into 8/<em>BITS</em> groups. Bits of a byte are numbered in a little-endian-ish way, as in <code>0x01</code>, <code>0x02</code>, <code>0x04</code>, <code>0x08</code>, <code>0x10</code>, <code>0x20</code>, <code>0x40</code>, <code>0x80</code>. For example, breaking the single input byte <code>chr(0x36)</code> into two groups gives a list <code>(0x6, 0x3)</code>; breaking it into 4 groups gives <code>(0x2, 0x1, 0x3, 0x0)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, a <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/pack.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>pack</code></a> template of <code>B*</code> specifies</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bit string (descending bit order inside each byte).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <code>N</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An unsigned long (32-bit) in ""network"" (big-endian) order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter is useful for assembling the message length. Although <code>pack</code> has a <code>Q</code> parameter for quad, the result is in the native order.</p>

<p>Start with a bit of prep work</p>

<pre><code>our($UPPER32BITS,$LOWER32BITS);
BEGIN {
  use Config;
  die ""$0: $^X not configured for 64-bit ints""
    unless $Config{use64bitint};

  # create non-portable 64-bit masks as constants
  no warnings ""portable"";
  *UPPER32BITS = \0xffff_ffff_0000_0000;
  *LOWER32BITS = \0x0000_0000_ffff_ffff;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can defined <code>pad_message</code> as</p>

<pre><code>sub pad_message {
  use bytes;

  my($msg) = @_;
  my $l = bytes::length($msg) * 8;
  my $extra = $l % 512;  # pad to 512-bit boundary
  my $k = 448 - ($extra + 1);

  # append 1 bit followed by $k zero bits
  $msg .= pack ""B*"", 1 . 0 x $k;

  # add big-endian length
  $msg .= pack ""NN"", (($l &amp; $UPPER32BITS) &gt;&gt; 32), ($l &amp; $LOWER32BITS);

  die ""$0: bad length: "", bytes::length $msg
    if (bytes::length($msg) * 8) % 512;

  $msg;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Say the code prints the padded message with</p>

<pre><code>my $padded = pad_message ""abc"";

# break into multiple lines for readability
for (unpack(""H*"", $padded) =~ /(.{64})/g) {
  print $_, ""\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the output is</p>

<pre>6162638000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

","<p>If you want to verify the signature of your app without the possibility that this is cracked too, you would have to upload the whole apk and make the check on a server. This is not a practicable solution.</p>

<p>The only secure android app is a pure terminal app, which means you'd have to do all computing on a server. Most of the time this won't be possible because of latency.</p>

<p>That's why we Android developers have to live with this: an app is not 100% secure.</p>

<p>You might want to read <a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Security with HTTPS and SSL</a> guide for securing your communication.</p>

<p>In your case you'll also want to implement server-side request validation:
If you have a game with a server side, users probably have an account. If a user sends a clearly impossible score, automatically disregard the request and ban the user (and his ip). (But also have in mind that this should never happen to a valid request, otherwise users might get angry and stop playing.)</p>

<p><strong>Do not use plain HTTP connection.</strong></p>

<p>4) Use some kind of <strong>request signing</strong> (like Amazon AWS does)
You can get core idea from their docs.
<a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html</a></p>

<p>Also <a href=""http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2008/04/21/rest-security-signing-requests-with-secret-key-but-does-it-work.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> should be helpful.</p>

<p>5) Prohibit usage of your app on <strong>ROOT</strong>'ed devices by adding run time check. Because of on rooted phone it's easier to hack or analyze your app.</p>

<p>6) You can decrease fraud by adding some ban system to your online game - if somebody hack your app and send wrong data to your server => add this user to ban list on server side (by IP or by user ID, etc). Probably add users to this list temporary (ex 24 hr, 7 days)</p>

<p>7) + if you are using Json/XML as data formats for network layer try to use binary format like <a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Protocol Buffers</a>. Binary serialization formats more efficient and hard to reverse engineer.</p>

"35381287","How to verify POST data is sent from Android app with correct SHA1 signature?","<p>Recently my game has been hacked and one user submitted an impossible score to the server. The score was submitted with a verified checksum, and correct data.</p>

<p>I'm convinced that the user must have reverse engineered my APK file to find the POST request.</p>

<p>Now I wonder what would be a good way to prevent this from happening again and I thought about verifying the SHA1 signature of the app. Maybe this way I can make sure that the app is signed by me, and is not a reverse engineered and changed version of the app.</p>

<p>Would this be possible? Or would there be a better solution to solve this?</p>

<p>I am using LibGDX by the way.</p>
","<p>You can obfuscate your code better and use some very obfuscated secret to sign your requests. With that you can increase security.</p>

<p>But if all your game run in client it can't be completely secure. Because it doesn't matter what you use to sign, if you do it in client it means you have the secret or private key in client and then it can be hacked.</p>

<p>To make it more secure you need to involve some game logic in server and then control in that logic that the user isn't cheating.</p>

<p>May the hmac hash function of php be different from java's one? </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p><strong>* SOLUTION</strong>  </p>

<p>Here is a copy of the php implementation by Rob Swan I mentioned:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// Define your secret seed
// NB: this is a hexadecimal representation of the example
// ASCII string which is: 12345678901234567890
$secret_seed = ""3132333435363738393031323334353637383930"";

// Determine the time window as 30 seconds
$time_window = 30;

// Set the timestamp manually
$exact_time = 1111111109;

// Round the time down to the time window
$rounded_time = floor($exact_time/$time_window);

// Pack the counter into binary
$packed_time = pack(""N"", $rounded_time);

// Make sure the packed time is 8 characters long
$padded_packed_time = str_pad($packed_time,8, chr(0), STR_PAD_LEFT);

// Pack the secret seed into a binary string
$packed_secret_seed = pack(""H*"", $secret_seed);

// Generate the hash using the SHA1 algorithm
$hash = hash_hmac ('sha1', $padded_packed_time, $packed_secret_seed, true);

// NB: Note we have change the exponent in the pow function 
// from 6 to 8 to generate an 8 digit OTP not a 6 digit one 

// Extract the 8 digit number fromt the hash as per RFC 6238
$offset = ord($hash[19]) &amp; 0xf;
$otp = (
    ((ord($hash[$offset+0]) &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; 24 ) |
    ((ord($hash[$offset+1]) &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 16 ) |
    ((ord($hash[$offset+2]) &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8 ) |
    (ord($hash[$offset+3]) &amp; 0xff)
) % pow(10, 8);

// NB: Note that we are padding to 8 characters not 6 for this example

// Add any missing zeros to the left of the numerical output
$otp = str_pad($otp, 8, ""0"", STR_PAD_LEFT);

// Display the output, which should be 
echo ""This should display 07081804: "" . $otp;

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The key point is this line: </p>

<pre><code>$offset = ord($hash[19]) &amp; 0xf;
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine under the hypotesis of using sha1 algorithm, which returns a 20 chars string. </p>

<p>To abstract the line and make it compatible with any other algorithm change this line to:</p>

<pre><code>$offset = ord($hash[strlen($hash)-1]) &amp; 0xf;

","<p>The solution by @SonOfHarpy technically works but has several issues, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>unnecessary use of temporary tables</li>
<li>overly complicated string assignment approach</li>
<li>use of fixed system table schema (<code>SYS.TABLE_COLUMNS</code>) instead of PUBLIC synonym</li>
<li>wrong data type and variable name for the input parameter</li>
</ul>

<p>An improved version of the code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>create procedure SHA_PREP (in TABLE_NAME nvarchar(256))
as 
begin
declare SQL_STR nvarchar(5000);

    SELECT 
          'UPDATE ""SCHEMA_NAME"".""TABLE_NAME"" SET ""SHA""= hash_sha256(' || STRING_AGG(A, ', ') || ')'
          into SQL_STR

        FROM TABLE_COLUMNS

                ""SCHEMA_NAME"" = 'SCHEMA_NAME' 
           AND ""TABLE_NAME"" = :TABLE_NAME
           AND ""COLUMN_NAME"" != 'SHA'
        ORDER BY POSITION 
        );

  --  select :sql_str from dummy; -- this is for debugging output only
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE (:SQL_STR);
end; 
</code></pre>

<p>By changing the <code>CONCAT</code> functions to the shorter <code>||</code> (double-pipe) operator, the code becomes a lot easier to read as the formerly nested function calls are now simple chained concatenations.  </p>

<p>By using <code>SELECT ... INTO variable</code> the whole nonsense with the temporary table can be avoided, again, making the code easier to understand and less prone to problems.</p>

<p>The input parameter name now correctly reflects its meaning and mirrors the HANA dictionary data type for <code>TABLE_NAME</code> (<code>NVARCHAR(256)</code>). </p>

<p>The procedure now consists of two commands (<code>SELECT</code> and <code>EXECUTE IMMEDIATE</code>) that each performs an essential task of the procedure:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Building a valid SQL update command string. </li>
<li>Executing the SQL command.</li>
</ol>

<p>I removed the useless line-comments but left a debugging statement as a comment in the code, so that the SQL string can be reviewed without having to execute the command. 
For that to work, obviously, the <code>EXECUTE...</code> line needs to be commented out and the debugging line has to be uncommented.</p>

<p>What's more worrying than the construction of the solution is its purpose.
It looks as if the <code>SHA</code> column should be used as a kind of shorthand row-data fingerprint. The <code>UPDATE</code> approach certainly handles this as an after-thought activity but leaves the ""finger-printing"" for the time when the update gets executed.</p>

<p>Also, it takes an essential part of the table design (that the <code>SHA</code> column should contain the fingerprint) away from the table definition.</p>

<p>An alternative to this could be a GENERATED COLUMN:</p>

<pre><code>create  table test (aaa int, bbb int);
alter table test add (sha varbinary (256) generated always as 
                        hash_sha256(to_varbinary(IFNULL(""AAA"",'0'))
                                 ,  to_varbinary(IFNULL(""BBB"",'0'))
                                    )
                       );

insert into test (aaa, bbb) values (12, 32);

select * from test;

/*
AAA BBB SHA

*/ 
</code></pre>

<p>With this, the ""generator"" approach could be used for table definition/modification time, but all the actual data handling would be automatically done by HANA, whenever values get changed in the table.<br>
Also, no separate calls to the procedure will ever be necessary as the fingerprints will always be current.</p>

","<p>A cryptographically secure hashing function is a function such that a given arbitrary length input is processed into a fixed length output in such a way that is not reversible (computationally infeasible). Such functions include MD5 and the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family (1, 224, 256, 384, 512, etc).</p>

<p>Once you take the hash of the input there is no going back to the original input. This property can be used for verification of message integrity as hashing the identical message produces a identical hash.</p>

<p>The website you visited simply stores hashes and their inputs side by side and does a database lookup for your hash to attempt to find a possible input (if it was previously added to the database).</p>

<p>as a <em>string</em> instead of an array of bytes. In other words, it's treating each character as a byte instead of parsing character pairs as bytes in hexadecimal. If I give this as a string to online calculators, I indeed get exactly what you got:</p>

<p>However, you're treating the output as an array of bytes instead of a <code>String</code> and that's giving you different results.

        byte[] strBytes = encodedSha256.getBytes(""UTF-8"");

It appears that sometimes the hash value has 256 bits, but sometimes it has only 255 bits. This is the code that I'm using to test BigInteger hashing:</p>

<pre><code>@Test
public void testSHA256LengthConsistent() {
    MessageDigest sha256 = null;
    try {
        sha256 = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");

        byte[] hash = sha256.digest(testNum.toByteArray());
        Assert.assertEquals(32, hash.length); //256 bits is 32 bytes

        Assert.assertEquals(256, hashedInt.bitLength());
    }

<p>(Yes, I'm using JUnit 4). This test fails on the third test number, where the second assert fails with ""Expected 256 but was 255.""</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with the way I'm converting BigIntegers to and from byte arrays? All of the examples I can find for Java's MessageDigest use it to hash Strings, not BigIntegers, so I don't know if there's a ""standard"" way to use BigIntegers with MessageDigest. Alternatively, is this a bug or edge case in the way Java does SHA-256, and there's something with 7153293421609183203421127438153268 (a number I generated randomly) that results in an off-by-one error in the hash?</p>

<p>By the way, I've already tried converting the hash to a negative BigInteger (using <code>new BigInteger(-1, hash)</code>) to see if it was a problem with the sign bit, but I get the exact same result. </p>

"12924185","Java's SHA-256 sometimes returns 255 bits","<p>I'm encountering some weird behavior when I use Java's <code>MessageDigest</code> to compute the  SHA-256 hash of a <code>BigInteger</code>. It appears that sometimes the hash value has 256 bits, but sometimes it has only 255 bits. This is the code that I'm using to test BigInteger hashing:</p>

<pre><code>@Test
public void testSHA256LengthConsistent() {
    MessageDigest sha256 = null;
    try {
        sha256 = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        Assert.fail(""NoSuchAlgorithmException. Can't construct the MessageDigest."");
    }
    BigInteger[] tests = {new BigInteger(""15902493""), new BigInteger(""5189087324092341824""), new BigInteger(""7153293421609183203421127438153268"")};
    for(BigInteger testNum : tests) {
        byte[] hash = sha256.digest(testNum.toByteArray());
        Assert.assertEquals(32, hash.length); //256 bits is 32 bytes
        BigInteger hashedInt = new BigInteger(1, hash);
        Assert.assertEquals(256, hashedInt.bitLength());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Yes, I'm using JUnit 4). This test fails on the third test number, where the second assert fails with ""Expected 256 but was 255.""</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with the way I'm converting BigIntegers to and from byte arrays? All of the examples I can find for Java's MessageDigest use it to hash Strings, not BigIntegers, so I don't know if there's a ""standard"" way to use BigIntegers with MessageDigest. Alternatively, is this a bug or edge case in the way Java does SHA-256, and there's something with 7153293421609183203421127438153268 (a number I generated randomly) that results in an off-by-one error in the hash?</p>

<p>By the way, I've already tried converting the hash to a negative BigInteger (using <code>new BigInteger(-1, hash)</code>) to see if it was a problem with the sign bit, but I get the exact same result. </p>
","<p>If you were to run a sufficient number of random tests, you would have seen that about half the results are 256 bits long, a quarter 255 bits long, one in eight 254 bits long etc. The reason is that each of the bits of the hash is effectively random, so there is a 50% probability that the high order bit (or, to be precise, any other specific bit you care to look at) is 1 and 50% that it is 0, and 25% probability that the two high order bits (or any other two specific bits you care to look at) are 00 (or any other value you care to test for) and so on.</p>

<p>And change the value:
<code>ads-interceptorclassname: arg.apache.directory.server.core.hash.ShaPasswordHashingInterceptor</code></p>

<p>By default, openldap is using:</p>

<pre>
ads-interceptorclassname: org.apache.directory.server.core.hash.SshaPasswordHashingInterceptor
</pre>

<p>Command to modify:</p>

<pre>
ldapmodify -h &lt;LDAP_HOST> -p &lt;LDAP_PORT> -D ""&lt;ADMIN_DN>"" -w ""&lt;ADMIN_PASSWORD>"" &lt;&lt;EOF

<p>For eg. : User passes a SHA-256 hash ""49454bcda10e0dd4543cfa39da9615a19950570129420f956352a58780550839"" as char* which will take 64 bytes. But this has to be compared with a hash inside the kernel space which is represented as u8 hash[32].</p>

<p>The hash inside the kernel gets properly printed in ASCII by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int i;
u8 hash[32];

for(i=0; i&lt;32; i++)
    printk(KERN_CONT ""%hhx "", hash[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>Output : 
""49 45 4b cd a1 0e 0d d4 54 3c fa 39 da 96 15 a1 99 50 57 01 29 42 0f 95 63 52 a5 87 80 55 08 39 ""</p>

<p>As the complete hash is stored in 32 bytes and printed as 64 chars in groups of 2 chars per u8 space, I assume that currently one u8 block stores information worth 2 chars i.e. 00101111 prints to be 2f.</p>

<p>Is there a way to store the 64 bytes string in 32 bytes so that it can be compared?</p>
","<p>Characters are often stored in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"" rel=""nofollow"">ASCII</a>, so start by having a look at an <a href=""http://www.asciitable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ASCII chart</a>. This will show you the relationship between a character like <code>'a'</code> and the number <code>97</code>.</p>

<p>You will note all of the numbers are right next to each other. This is why you often see people do <code>c-'0'</code> or <code>c-48</code> since it will convert the ASCII-encoded digits into numbers you can use.</p>

<p>However you will note that the letters and the numbers are far away from each other, which is slightly less convenient. If you arrange them by bits, you may notice a pattern: Bit 6 (&amp;64) is set for letters, but unset for digits. Observing that, converting hex-ASCII into numbers is straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>int h2i(char c){return (9*!!(c&amp;64))+(c&amp;15);}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have converted a single character, converting a string is also straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>void hs(char*d,char*s){while(*s){*d=(h2i(*s)*16)+h2i(s[1]);s+=2;++d;}}
</code></pre>

<p>Adding support for non-hex characters embedded (like whitespace) is a useful exercise you can do to convince yourself you understand what is going on.</p>

<p>For eg. : User passes a SHA-256 hash ""49454bcda10e0dd4543cfa39da9615a19950570129420f956352a58780550839"" as char* which will take 64 bytes. But this has to be compared with a hash inside the kernel space which is represented as u8 hash[32].</p>

<p>The hash inside the kernel gets properly printed in ASCII by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int i;
u8 hash[32];

for(i=0; i&lt;32; i++)
    printk(KERN_CONT ""%hhx "", hash[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>Output : 
""49 45 4b cd a1 0e 0d d4 54 3c fa 39 da 96 15 a1 99 50 57 01 29 42 0f 95 63 52 a5 87 80 55 08 39 ""</p>

<p>As the complete hash is stored in 32 bytes and printed as 64 chars in groups of 2 chars per u8 space, I assume that currently one u8 block stores information worth 2 chars i.e. 00101111 prints to be 2f.</p>

<p>Is there a way to store the 64 bytes string in 32 bytes so that it can be compared?</p>
","<p>Here is how to use <code>scanf</code> to do the conversion:</p>

<pre><code>char *shaStr = ""49454bcda10e0dd4543cfa39da9615a19950570129420f956352a58780550839"";
uint8_t sha[32];
for (int i = 0 ; i != 32 ; i++) {
    sscanf(shaStr+2*i, ""%2"" SCNx8, &amp;sha[i]);
    printf(""%02x "", sha[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The approach here is to call <code>sscanf</code> repeatedly with the <code>""%2"" SCNx8</code> format specifier, which means ""two hex characters converted to <code>uint8_t</code>"". The position is determined by the index of the loop iteration, i.e. <code>shaStr+2*i</code></p>

<p>Ideas? Thanks.</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>one: do not do. It better to distribute DCrypt library with ur component and allow user to update it to more recent versions.
If sha256 would turn buggy, or incompatible with newer Delphi version - what would you do ? If u use DCrypt, then you just download new version of it. If you isolated it - then u have to fix it yourself. Do you have enough skils in both Delphi and crypto mathematics, to always doo all fixes of sha256 code and new Delphi versions in future ?</p></li>
<li><p>But if you insist - then launch to Delphi side by side. In one open DCrypt sources, in another open new empty unit. Copy sha256-generating procedure from DCrypt to empty unit and try to compile. Delphi would tell you of unknown identificators. Look into Dcrypt Delphi and find the declarations of them. If they are from DCpypt too - then copy them again into the new unit. If they are from RTL/VCL - add the unit into USES of your new unit. And try to compile again. Repeat this until all the identifiers are either resolved by USES or copied from DCrypt into your file.
After it compiles - take some file and calculate hashes by DCrypt and by you new library - if they are different, that means you had borken something and have to find and fix it (you have enought crypto math experience, don't you).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I made Win64 asm optimizations for Spring4D sha code and all that code was covered by unit tests, so i always new if my optimizations broke things or not. Without those total testign policy i'd not be able to do it.</p>

<p>I strongly advice you to stick with DCrypt or Lockbox3 or Spring4D or any other strong living library and not isolate yourself. Keep together with community and you can use their labor for yourself. Isolate - and you would have to re-do it each time new bug or incompatibility would face up.</p>

<p>You cannot extract code from library - why do you think you would be able to upgrade that code to XE4/5/6... and prove it was not broken ?</p>

","<p>What you're describing is evaluating hash function's 'avalanche property';  if you change the input just a little bit, how much does the output change?  Any decent hashing function should be able to completely mangle the result drastically even if the input changes just one bit.  This is why things like salts and nonces work well, because adding few bytes to the initial string (which by itself might be weak, short or predictable, like passwords), changes the result of the hash to something completely different and unrelated to the original.</p>

<p>to answer your question more directly tho:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 2008 attack breaks preimage
  resistance for 46 out of 80 rounds of
  SHA-512, and 41 out of 64 rounds of

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two meet-in-the-middle preimage attacks against SHA-2 with a reduced number of rounds. The first one attacks 41-round SHA-256 out of 64 rounds with time complexity of 2253.5 and space complexity of 216, and 46-round SHA-512 out of 80 rounds with time 2511.5 and space 23.

","<p>SHA-1 hashes are 20 bytes (160 bits) in length. If you are dealing with 40 character hashes, then they are probably an ASCII representation of the hash, and therefore only contain the characters 0-9 and a-f. If this is the case, then you should be able to read and manipulate the strings in Java without any trouble.</p>

","<p>Some more details could be useful, but I think the answer is that you should be okay.</p>

<p>You didn't say how the SHA-1 hash was encoded (common possibilities include ""none"" (the raw bytes), Base64 and hex). Since SHA-1 produces a 20 byte (160 bit) hash, I am guessing that it will be encoded using hex, since that doubles the space needed to the 40 bytes you mentioned. With that encoding, 2 characters will be used to encode each byte from the hash, using the symbols 0 through 9 and A through F. Those are all ASCII characters so you are safe.</p>

<p>Base64 encoding would also work (though probably not what you asked about since it increases the size by about 1/3 leaving you at well less than 40 bytes) as each of the characters used in Base64 are also ASCII.</p>

<p>If the raw bytes were used directly, you would have a problem, as some of the values are not valid characters.</p>

However at the point where the SqlMembershipProvider compares the password from the database with the hashed password entered, they aren't the same. </p>

","<p>First copy the production app to dev/test and run it there to see if it works as expected.
If it does, proceed to upgrade the project to run under .NET 4.0, but do not modify any other code (ie. don't try to make it work with SQLMembershipProvider) - retest the application
If that works, you know it's not an environment issue, and it's not a .NET breaking change issue, which would point to something in your code not working as you expect it should work.

"34979463","Windows 10 ignores Authenticode on my setups files","<p>Being on the ""Fast Ring"" of Windows 10, I got a strange behaviour on my own setup executables:</p>

<p>I'm SHA-1 signing them with <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537359(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Authenticode</a> since years the same way and never had any problems. </p>

<p>Recently Windows 10 does not recognize my (valid) signatures.</p>

<p>When downloading a setup.exe from my website and executing it, the Windows SmartScreen message box appears and tells me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...<br>
  Publisher: unknown<br>
  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When viewing the properties of the just downloaded setup executable, it shows the signature, and tells me that the signature is valid.</p>

<p>In addition, the whole certificate chain is valid.</p>

<p>I'm signing it with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SignTool.exe sign /v /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll 
    /f ""my-authenticode.pfx"" /p ""my-password"" ""my-setup.exe""
</code></pre>

<p>(Line-breaks added for readability)</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Is anyone aware of a possible reason (and fix) for this?</p>

<p><strong>More Information</strong>:</p>

<p>I can think of possible reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strike>Signing with Windows 10 Fast Ring is buggy</strike>. (I've signed on Windows Server 2008 R2 with the same behaviour).</li>
<li>Running the downloaded setup executable within Windows 10 Fast Ring is buggy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>I've found <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsnetsetup/archive/2013/01/09/windows-smartscreen-prevented-an-unrecognized-app-from-running-running-this-app-might-put-your-pc-at-risk.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a MSDN blog article back from 2013 that seems to talk about something similar</a> as I discover, but I still cannot see whether this really applies.</p>

<p>More strange: Older downloads from our website, signed with the same Authenticode certificate do <em>not</em> trigger the warning.</p>

<p>Maybe SmartScreen compares the timestamp and behaves differently for newer signatures/setup executables?</p>

<p>Maybe I would need to add additional/different parameters when calling SignTool.exe?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>On a non-Fast Ring Windows 10, the SmartScreen warning is <em>not</em> displayed.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/25163521/107625"">there is also a similar SO posting</a> which didn't help me further.</p>

<p>Plus, <a href=""https://knowledge.symantec.com/support/code-signing-support/index?page=content&amp;id=INFO190&amp;actp=LIST&amp;viewlocale=en_US"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there is a Symantec posting, that claims</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Windows Vista 64-bit and Windows 7 the signing process has changed. The code cannot simply be signed, it also needs to be ""cross-signed"" with a certificate provided by Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is strange to me since my signing procedure worked successfully until recently.</p>

<p>This seems to go into the right direction.</p>

<p>I've seen that my current certificate is SHA-1. I've just updated it to SHA-2/SHA-256 by re-issuing it from Thawte.</p>

<p>Now, I still get a SmartScreen warning on my local Windows 10 Fast Ring PC but at least it now prints the publisher.</p>

<p>I'll no purchase a <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/code-signing.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code signing cert from DigiCert</a> since I believe that the certificate chain also has influence on how the SmartScreen filter sees my application. I do hope it is an improvement compared to the Thawte certificate I'm currently using.</p>

<p>If you plan to sign for Windows Vista, please note that there <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/kb/2763674"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">was a problem with SHA-256 signed files</a>. The linked TechNet article talks about <a href=""http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32288.windows-enforcement-of-authenticode-code-signing-and-timestamping.aspx#How_to_dual_sign_files"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dual signing</a> to overcome this.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:</strong></p>

<p>See also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/28359323/107625"">this SO answer</a> that deals about passing the SmartScreen warning with signed applications.</p>

<p>If this DigiCert certificate plus waiting to get enough reputation still does not help, I'll probably have to swallow the bitter pill and buy an <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extended validation (EV) code signing certificate</a> (which requires a hardware token and is more expensive).</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:</strong></p>

<p>After approx. one day, SmartScreen seems to <em>not</em> show any warnings anymore.</p>

<p>Seems that my now dual-signed setup executables (SHA-1 plus SHA-256) already got enough reputation to successfully pass the SmartScreen tests.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kr1oE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kr1oE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My certification path/chain now looks like this:</p>

<p>What looks a bit strange to me is that the root certificate ""thawte"" still uses SHA-1. </p>

<p>I would have expected that this still causes SmartScreen worries, but it seems it doesn't.</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:</strong></p>

<p>The article ""<a href=""https://www.entrust.com/need-sha-2-signed-root-certificates/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Do You Need SHA-2 Signed Root Certificates?</a>"" explains why you do <em>not</em> need a SHA-256 root certificate.</p>

<p>In the meantime I've also received my Authenticode certificate from DigiCert. I'm using it in some setups already.</p>

<p>It only took about one single day until the SmartScreen filter did pick it up and <em>not</em> warn about it anymore.</p>

<p>So I'm now having a Thawte Authenticode code signing certificate and a DigiCert Authenticode code signing certificate.</p>

<p>If I understood the SHA-256 implications earlier, I could have saved the money for the DigiCert certificate.</p>

I have some 32-bit <code>unsigned</code> signals defined as such:</p>

<pre><code>SIGNAL a, b : UNSIGNED (31 downto 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Within the specifications of the SHA-256 algorithm, it says addition must be performed modulo 2^32 in order to retain the 32-bit size in case of an overflow.    Now, according to the answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11769754/is-overflow-defined-for-vhdl-numeric-std-signed-unsigned"">this</a> question, it sounds like overflow is already handled with modular addition in VHDL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no overflow handling, the overflow carry is simply lost. Thus the result is simply the integer result of your operation modulo 2^MAX.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>In my case, <code>MAX = 31</code> so does that mean that any addition operation I perform on <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will be modded with 2^31?  </li>
<li>I need to perform addition modulo 2^<strong>32</strong> which obviously doesn't make sense since I am working with 32-bit numbers and 2^32 is one bit too large.  So is it somehow implied that I should actually be modding with 2^<strong>31</strong>?</li>
</ol>
","<p>You are fine with <code>unsigned(31 downto 0)</code>. The <code>2^MAX</code> in the post you reference is an error and should read <code>2^length</code>. The length of <code>31 downto 0</code> is 32.</p>

<p>Think about it, <code>31 downto 0</code> can represent numbers from 0 to 2^32-1, it wouldn't make much sense if any addition of that range would be modulo 2^31 if you can represent larger numbers!</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand your second question, but addition modulo 2^32 yields results in the range of 0 to 2^32-1. 2^32 is illegal, thus it's quite fine that you can't represent it with your unsigned.</p>

"21579634","Store SHA1 hash digest of a FreeRADIUS user password in PostgreSQL","<p>I have a system with a centralized user database where usernames and passwords are stored for different application.
The database is created in PostgreSQL. FreeRDAIUS gets access to the users and passwords via OpenLDAP which uses PostgreSQL as a backend system. The passwords are supposed to be stored in their hash formats.
I have tested FreeRADIUS with SHA1 passwords stored in the database and users are successfully authenticated. I stored the digest with {SHA} prepnded to it and it work perfectly. This hash, however, needs to be in base64 with ""="" as the a padding character. I generated the base64 hash digest using ldap utility slappasswd.</p>

<p>Since in reality, I am supposed to insert users in the database using a C function and the available cryptographic libs such as OpenSSL only offer function for hex hash, I thought the best way is to know how to tell FreeRDAIUS that the digest stored in the database is NOT base64 but HEX. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can do this? It seems that if I simply put {SHA} before the hashed value, it only works for base64 with FreeRADIUS. I would also like to know if FreeRADIUS supports other hash algorithms such as SHA256.</p>

<p>OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
PostgreSQL: 9.1
FreeRADIUS: 2.1.10</p>
","<p>No currently released versions support any of the SHA-2 hash algorithms.</p>

<p>The rlm_pap module in FreeRADIUS 2.1.10 should automatically 'normify' the 'known good' password, that is convert the hexits to binary, and assign it to the correct <code>control:</code> attribute. This works the same way for hexits as it does base64.</p>

<p>They're not, really. They're the same bits. It's just that Java doesn't have unsigned bytes - so any byte with the top bit set is negative. In every case like that, you'll see that Java result = Go result - 256.</p>

<p>If you convert both byte arrays to hex or base64, you'll see same results.</p>

<p>although using UTF8 Encoding in objective c does work, I cannot use it as it will give a different byte array than the one generated in .Net which will result a completely different SHA for that string.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
","<p>The best solution would be if the server used UTF-8 instead of ASCII encoding.
If that is not an option, you can use the following code for the conversion,
where all non-ASCII characters are substituted by a question mark
(error-checking omitted for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>NSString *myString = @""ä123€456¥"";

CFIndex asciiLength;
// Determine length of converted data:
CFStringGetBytes((__bridge CFStringRef)(myString), CFRangeMake(0, [myString length]),
                 kCFStringEncodingASCII, '?', false, NULL, 0, &amp;asciiLength);
// Allocate buffer:
uint8_t *asciiBuffer = malloc(asciiLength);
// Do the conversion:
CFStringGetBytes((__bridge CFStringRef)(myString), CFRangeMake(0, [myString length]),
                 kCFStringEncodingASCII, '?', false, asciiBuffer, asciiLength, NULL);

// Check the result:
printf(""%.*s\n"", (int)asciiLength, asciiBuffer);
// Output: ?123?456?
</code></pre>

<p>There is (as far as I know) no equivalent <code>NSString</code> method, therefore you have
to use the ""toll-free bridge"" from <code>NSString</code> to <code>CFStringRef</code> and a Core Foundation
function.</p>

"19982951","How does Firefox generate the hash values when installing extensions","<p>I wrote some code that manually takes a XPI that was already installed from one Firefox profile, and set's up the xpi to be manually set up on a different profile or computer entirely.</p>

<p>So the I set everything up fine within the extensions.sqlite Database that is within the user profile folder. I can even rename the extension on the fly when I move the xpi itself into the extension folder.</p>

<p>Here's my question: When I extract the XPI, there is a file called 'harness-options.json'. Within that file there are two variables, docsSHA256 and jsSHA256.</p>

<p>These to hash variables must be based on the extension in some way, but I am not sure how exactly.</p>

<p>Could anyone point me in the right direction as to how firefox generates these hash codes?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Firefox does not generate these hashes at all. It is the Add-on SDK which does. The Firefox extension manager does not care about <code>harness-options.json</code> at all. The SDK loader in turn, does care about <code>harness-options.json</code> a bit, but doesn't do anything with <code>jsSHA256</code> or <code>docsSHA256</code> at the moment. Other tools, such as the validator that runs when you upload something to addons.mozilla.org, do care about <code>jsSHA256</code> at least.</p>

<p>It should be noted that add-ons not using the SDK do not (normally) contain a <code>harness-options.json</code> file at all.</p>

<p>There will be one <code>jsSHA256</code> per module <code>lib/</code>, e.g. one for <code>main.js</code> and so on.</p>

<p><code>docsSHA256</code> for <code>main.js</code> will be generated from <code>README.md</code> when the SDK builds the XPI. Apparantly, <code>README.md</code> is not packed into the XPI. For all other modules it appears <code>docsSHA256</code> appears to be null.</p>

<p>The code in question lives in <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/d506602d7a01f89f4b372bbd0c9e260340ebc596/python-lib/cuddlefish/manifest.py"" rel=""nofollow""><code>manifest.py</code></a>.</p>

<p>In the end you shouldn't mess with the XPI (other than repacking an unpacked extension) and/or <code>extensions.sqlite</code> at all. Especially the latter isn't meant to be modified externally.
Just drop the your XPIs files in the corresponding <code>extensions/</code> folder of the profile and the Add-on manager will automatically pick them up the next time you start the browser.</p>

<p>I'd like to convert hex string like <code>77f4de214a5423e3c7df8704f65af57c39c55f08424c75c0931ab09a5bfdf49f5f939f2caeff1e0113d9b3d6363583e4830cf40787100b750cde76f00b8cd3ec</code> (example produced by <code>sha512sum</code>) into a binary file (64 bytes long), in which each byte's value would be equivalent to a pair of letters/digits from the string. I'm looking for a solution that would require minimal amount of tools, so I'd be happy if this can be done easily with <code>bash</code>, <code>sed</code> or some utility from coreutils. I'd rather avoid <code>xxd</code>, as this doesn't seem to handle such string anyway (I'd have to add ""addresses"" and some whitespace).</p>

<p>I need the hash as a binary file, to convert it into an object file and link with the application that I'm writing. If there's another way to embed such string (in a binary form!) into application (via an array or whatever) - it's also a solution for me.</p>

For example, MD5 can generated hashing with length of 128 bits. However, I need to define various hashing function with designed lengths such as 10,16,20, ...</p>
","<p>Here's a possible solution if you employ the <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25921-calcmd5"" rel=""nofollow"">CalcMD5</a> package from <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange"" rel=""nofollow"">FEX (Matlab File Exchange)</a>:</p>

<pre><code>function hash = myhash(len, value)
% len: The desired hash length. Integer
% value: The value to hash. String.

% Set this to whatever hash length your native hash algorithm employs.
nativehashlength = 32;
if len &lt;= nativehashlength
    % Using the CalcMD5 package to obtain MD5 hash
    hash = CalcMD5(value);
    hash = hash(1:len);
else
    % Could to a lot of stuff, but i choose to hash the repeated value
    runs = ceil(len/nativehashlength);
    hash = [];
    aggregated = value;
    for r = 1:runs
        % Compute hash and add to hash string
        hash = [hash CalcMD5(aggregated)]; %#ok
        % Update the aggregate
        aggregated = [aggregated value]; %#ok
    end
    hash = hash(1:len);
end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This also works for strings/char arrays of short length, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; myhash(100,'hello')
ans = 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c59223b431acfeb41e15d466d75de822307c99fb31087791f6317ad7c6da1433f1729436
&gt;&gt; myhash(2,'world') 
ans =
7d
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the hash of size 10 for 'hello' will equal the first ten hash characters of the size 20 hash of 'hello', but it was not asked to generate very different hash functions depending on the desired hash size. this could, however, be easily implemented by salting the value with the requested hash size, for example.</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>So BouncyCastle(the crypto provider in Andorid) doesn't implement PBKDF2 using SHA256, so you will have to get very slightly custom.  This <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11642114/1904979"">SO answer</a> tells you which class to modify to get the algorithm set up.  Then you will need to integrate it, or figure out how to call it yourself (and I'm afraid I can't help much on that)</p>

<p>as far as the hash itself goes the format (as <a href=""http://pythonhosted.org/passlib/lib/passlib.hash.django_std.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">defined here</a>) is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;algorithm&gt;$&lt;iteration count&gt;$&lt;salt&gt;$&lt;hash&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where in your case the iteration count is 10000, your salt is the ascii string <code>v2WJyd8HkqhU</code> and the the hash is the byte array represented by the base64 string <code>QVAp707PYTiFDHvzjwBCTbecr9+6q2OIPsunPyOxXGU=</code></p>

<p>You will compute the hash of the utf8 string of the password with the parameters specified.  Then, you can either base64 encode the output of the hash and compare the strings, or base64 decode the recieved hash and compare the byte arrays.  Apache Commons Codec provides some good Base64 encoding/decoding methods in its <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base64.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Base64</a> class.</p>

"19975198","JSON generate unique hash value (SHA-512)","<p>I'm searching for a way to generate a SHA-512 hash from a json string in Ruby, independent from the positions of the elements in it, and independent from nestings, arrays, nested arrays and so on. I just want to hash the raw data along with its keys.</p>

<p>I tried some approaches with converting the JSON into a ruby hash, deep sort them by their keys, append everything into one, long string and hash it. But I bet that my solution isn't the most efficient one, and that there must be a better way to do this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>So far, I convert JSON into a Ruby hash. Then I try to use this function to get a canonical representation:</p>

<pre><code>  def self.canonical_string_from_hash value, key=nil
    str = """"
    if value.is_a? Hash
      value.keys.sort.each do |k|
        str += canonical_string_from_hash(value[k], k)
      end
    elsif value.is_a? Array
      str += key.to_s
      value.each do |v|
        str += canonical_string_from_hash(v)
      end
    else
      str += key ? ""#{key}#{value}"" : value.to_s
    end
    return str
  end
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm not sure, if this is a good and efficient way to do this.</p>

<p>For example, this hash</p>

<pre><code>hash = {
  id: 3,
  zoo: ""test"",
  global: [
    {ukulele: ""ringding"", blub: 3},
    {blub: nil, ukulele: ""rangdang"", guitar: ""stringstring""}
  ],
  foo: {
    ids: [3,4,5],
    bar: ""asdf""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>gets converted to this string:</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>But I'm not sure, if this is a good and efficient way to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on what you are trying to do. Your canonical/equivalent structures need to represent what is important to you for the comparison. Removing details such as object structure makes sense if you consider two items with different structure but same string values equivalent.</p>

<p>According to your comments, you are attempting to sign a request that is being transferred from one system to a second one. In other words you want <em>security</em>, not a measure of similarity or a digital fingerprint for some other purpose. Therefore equivalent requests are ones that are identical in all the ways that affect the processing that you want to protect. It is simpler, and very likely more secure, to lock down the raw bytes of data that transfer between your two systems.</p>

<p>In which case your whole approach needs a re-think. The reasons for that are probably best discussed on security.stackoverflow.com</p>

<p>However, in brief:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use an HMAC routine (HMAC-SHA512), it is designed for your purpose. Instead of a salt, this uses a secret, which is essentially the same thing (in fact you need to keep your salt a secret in your implementation too, which is unusual for something called a salt), but has been combined with the SHA in a way which makes it resilient to a couple of attack forms possible against simple concatenation followed by SHA. The worst of these is that it is possible to extend the data and have it generate the same SHA when processed, <em>without needing to know the salt</em>. In other words, an attacker could take a known valid request and use it to forge other requests which will get past your security check. Your proposed solution looks vulnerable to this form of attack to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Unpacking the request and analysing the details to get a ""canonical"" view of the request is not necessary, and also reduces the security of your solution. The only reason for doing this is that you are for some reason not able to handle the request once it has been serialised to JSON, and are forced to work only with the de-serialised request at one end or another of the two systems. If that is purely a knowledge or convenience thing, then fix that problem rather than trying to roll your own security protocol using SHA-512.</p></li>
<li><p>You should sign the request, and check the signature, against the fully serialised JSON string. If you need to de-serialise data from a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack, then you are potentially already exposed to some attacks via the parser. You should work to reject suspect requests before any data processing has been done to them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR - ALthough not a direct answer to your question, the correct solution for you is to not write this code <em>at all</em>. Instead you need to place your secure signature code closer to the ins and outs of your two services that need to trust each other.</p>

<p>And, is this really critical? Even if your password is salted?</p>
","<p>The main reason not to use MD5 for <em>hashing passwords</em> is not the fact that MD5 is severely compromised or even considered broken.</p>

<p>It’s true, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security"">MD5 has known vulnerabilities</a>. But none of them do pose a serious threat to your use of MD5. Because in your case the only threat would be a preimage attack where an attacker would try to find a preimage of a known hash, e.g. the password to a known (salted) password hash. And the probably known preimage attack against MD5 is only theoretical and lowers the effort from 2<sup>128</sup> to 2<sup>123.4</sup>, which is no big advantage. A brute-force attack with an average of 2<sup>64</sup> is still more promising.</p>

<p>No, the main reason not to use MD5 is because <strong>MD5 is too fast</strong>. With a todays affordable computer you can <a href=""http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-plus/#performance"">generate and test 7190M MD5 hashes per second</a>. All 8 characters long combinations of alphanumeric characters can be brute-forced in about 8.5 hours, no matter whether with or without salt.</p>

<p>In contrast to that, with the hash function like <code>bcrypt $2a$</code> one can only generate and test 4085 hashes per second, so only 0.00005682 % of the number of MD5 hashes. With <code>bcrypt $2a$</code> you would need 1694 years for the same attempt.</p>

"20270081","Java how to do sha256 hashing equiavelent to php crypt function ? result is not the same?","<p>I am using this <a href=""http://raginggoblin.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/java-alternative-to-php-crypt-function/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raginggoblin.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/java-alternative-to-php-crypt-function/</a>  for the equivalent of php crypt function or does it says here that it is...</p>

<p>But I have the same value in java and in php but the hashing result is different.. I was wondering if not hashing is different because its not executed the same way ? I post this two values to a WS.</p>

<pre><code>JAVA:


 String doc_data=""{\""table\"":\""1048582\""}"";
 String data=""$5$rounds=5000$503$La071hYxZERff9GGq0cb.x2k96Xx25\/C4vxQztQ7B96"";
 String result=Crypt.crypt(doc_data, data);

PHP: 
 $params['result'] = crypt($params['doc_data'], @$this-&gt;initdata['data']);
</code></pre>

<p>I logged it and I put the exact data in from POST... but the result is not the same.. There is no way to do this right ? or there is no equivalent?</p>

<p>Before that library I used Guava..but still not the same</p>

<pre><code>public static String crypt_sha256(String password, String salt) {
        int iteration_count = 5000;
        HashFunction func = Hashing.sha256();
        HashCode result = func.hashString(salt + param1, Charsets.UTF_8);

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; iteration_count; i++) {
            result = func.hashBytes(result.asBytes());
        }

        return salt + result.toString();

}

","<p>MS-DOS used the CR-LF convention,So basically while saving the file in windows, <code>\r\n</code> comes in effect for carriage return and newline. And while testing on online (given by you),  only  <code>\n</code> character comes in effect. 
Thus either you have to check the checksum of <code>Test Message\r\nHello World\r\n</code> in string which is equivalent to creating and reading file in windows(as given above), which is the case here. </p>

<p>However, the checksum of files,wherever created, will be same.</p>

","<p>It seems the problem was associated with the value of length I passed in  <code>EVP_DigestUpdate</code>. I had passed value from <code>strlen</code>, but replacing it with <code>bufferS</code> did fixed the issue. 
The code was modified as:</p>

<pre><code>while(!readfile.eof() &amp;&amp; readfile.is_open() &amp;&amp; temp_fil&gt;0)
{
  int bufferS = (temp_fil &lt; MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) ? temp_fil : MAX_BUFFER_SIZE;

  buffer[bufferS] = 0;
  readfile.read(buffer, bufferS);
  EVP_DigestUpdate(mdctx, buffer, bufferS);
  temp_fil -= bufferS;
  delete[] buffer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and to send the checksum string, I modified the code as:</p>

<pre><code>EVP_DigestFinal_ex(mdctx, md_value, &amp;md_len);
EVP_MD_CTX_destroy(mdctx);
char str[128] = { 0 };
char *ptr = str;
std::string ret;
for(i = 0; i &lt; md_len; i++)
 {
    //_snprintf(checksum_msg+cx,md_len-cx,""%02x"",md_value[i]);
     sprintf(ptr,""%02x"", md_value[i]);
     ptr += 2;
 }

ret = str;
/* Call this once before exit. */
EVP_cleanup();
return ret;
</code></pre>

<p>As for the wrong checksum earlier, the problem was associated in how windows keeps the line feed. As suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662069/zangetsu"">Zangetsu</a>, Windows was making text file as <code>CRLF</code>, but linux and the site I mentioned earlier was using <code>LF</code>. Thus there was difference in the checksum value. For files other than text, eg <code>dll</code> the code now computes correct checksum as string</p>

","<p>I think I figured this out and it's just a typo, at least when I cut and paste your commands above! You download <code>SHASUMS256.txt</code> but test against a file called <code>SHASUM256.txt</code> (missing the <code>S</code>). Because you throw away the output and pipe it to grep, you weren't seeing that error. </p>

<p>Actually, it doesn't say that.  It can't say that, because that does not make sense.</p>

<p>In fact, if the UUID spec says anything about the uniqueness of type 4 UUIDs it would say that they are <em>only as good as the source of random numbers</em>.  And that depends on the platform and the quality of the RNG &amp; UUID implementations.  If we can assume a perfect<sup>1</sup> source of random numbers, then the probability of any two (separately generated) UUIDs being the same is on in 2<sup>122</sup>; i.e. very, very small.  On the other hand, if you have a poor source of random numbers, the probability of pair-wise collision increases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So isn't this above piece of code actually reducing the quality of uniqueness by hashing it with MD5 which is an obsolete hashing mechanism now and prone to collisions and attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  But MD5 isn't the real problem.</p>

<p>As @Doug Stevenson says, hashing a UUID does not reduce the chance of a collision.  Not even for a hashing algorithm that has no known weakness.  Whatever the algorithm, there is a chance that hashing UUIDs will increase the probability of collisions<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>So basically, there is no point in hashing a single UUID.  </p>

<p>However, if you required a token that had a smaller probability of collision than a type 4 UUID, you could concatenate N type 4 UUIDs into a single byte array, and then create a hash for the array.  If you have a (strong) M-bit hashing algorithm, and a perfect source of random numbers for your UUID generator, then the chance of collision should be roughly one in 2<sup>min(M, 122 * N)</sup>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1 - That is, a source of random bits where it is impossible for someone (an attacker) to predict the next bit in the sequence with anything other than 50% probability of being correct.</sup></p>

<p><sup>2 - This will happen if there are any two distinct UUIDs that have the same hash.  That is possible even for a strong hashing algorithm ... unless you defined that to be a criteria by which you measure strength.</sup></p>

<p>Alright, so I know that SHA-1 produces a hash of 160 bits. </p>

","<p>Yes, you're right; this circles around the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Birthday Problem</a>. In hashing you are essentially trying to place a something that can be of theoretically infinite length into a fixed length string through a mathematical process; a collision is therefore inevitable. </p>

<p>The Birthday Problem basically means that suppose you had a hall full of people, you ask each person their date of birth. The probability of finding someone with the same birthday as another increases as you have more dates of birth which two people could have as the same. And eventually you will find someone who has the same birthday.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yNQjE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yNQjE.png"" alt=""Graph of the birthday problem""></a></p>

<p>Aaron Toponce wrote about this in his piece <a href=""https://pthree.org/2014/03/06/the-reality-of-sha1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""The Reality of SHA1""</a> where he pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SHA1 was meant to be a replacement for MD5. MD5 has an output space of
  only 128-bits, where as SHA1 has an output space of 160-bits. SHA1 is
  also designed differently than MD5, and is meant to not suffer the
  same sort of weaknesses or attacks that MD5 faces. However, over time,
  cryptographers have been able to severely attack SHA1, and as a
  result, they've all been warning us to get off SHA1, and move to SHA2.
  It should take 2^160 operations to find a collision with SHA1, however
  using the Birthday Paradox, we can have a probability of 50% of
  finding a SHA1 collision in about 2^80 operations. However,
  cryptanalysists have torn down SHA1 to a complexity of only 2^61
  operations. Even better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, the SHA1 is a mathematical algorithm, weaknesses can be found in algorithms which make them easier crack and reduce the probability of a collision. This research, usually done by computer scientists, cryptographers and mathematicians then can be used to reduce the chance of finding a collision by using new algorithms to find new ways of finding collisions. </p>

"22976617","OpenCL SHA1 Throughput Optimisation","<p>Hoping someone more experienced in OpenCL usage may be able to help me here!!  I'm doing a project (to help me learn a bit more crypto and to try my hand at GPGPU programming) where I'm trying to implement my own SHA1 algo. Ultimately my question is about maximizing my throughput rates - at present I'm seeing something like 56.1 MH/sec, which compares very badly to OpenSource programs I've looked at, such as John the Ripper and OCLHashcat, which are giving 1000 and 1500 MH/sec respectively (heck, I'd be well-chuffed with a 3rd of that!).</p>

<p>So, what I'm doing; I've written a SHA1 implementation in an OpenCL kernel and a C++ host application to load data to the GPU (using CL 1.2 C++ wrapper).  I'm generating blocks of candidate data to hash in a threaded fashion on the CPU and loading this data onto the global GPU memory using the CL C++ call to enqueueWriteBuffer (using uchars to represent the bytes to hash):</p>

<pre><code>    errorCode = dispatchQueue-&gt;enqueueWriteBuffer(
        inputBuffer,
        CL_FALSE,//CL_TRUE,
        0,
        sizeof(cl_uchar) * inputBufferSize,
        passwordBuffer,
        NULL,
        &amp;dispatchDelegate);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm en-queuing data using enqueueNDRangeKernel in the following manner (where global  worksize is a user-defined variable, at present I've set this to my GPUs maximum flattened global worksize of 16.777 million per run):</p>

<pre><code>errorCode = dispatchQueue-&gt;enqueueNDRangeKernel(
    *kernel,
    NullRange,
    NDRange(globalWorkgroupSize, 1), 
    NullRange, 
    NULL,
    NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning, that per dispatch, I load 16.777 million items in a 1D array and index from my kernel into this using get_global_offset(0).  My Kernel signature:</p>

<pre><code>__kernel void sha1Crack(__global uchar* out, __global uchar* in, 
                        __constant int* passLen, __constant int* targetHash, 
                        __global bool* collisionFound)
{
    //Kernel Instance Global GPU Mem IO Mapping:
    __private int id = get_global_id(0);
    __private int inputIndexStart = id * passwordLen;

    //Select Password input key space:
    #pragma unroll
    for (i = 0; i &lt; passwordLen; i++)
    {
        inputMem[i] = in[inputIndexStart + i];
    }

    //SHA1 Code omitted for brevity...
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, given this, am I doing something fundamentally wrong in the way I'm loading data? i.e. 1 call to enqueueNDrange for 16.7 million kernel executions over a 1D input vector? (should I be using a 2D space and sub-dividing into localworkgroup ranges? - I tried playing with this but it didn't seem quicker). </p>

<p>Or, perhaps as likely is my algorithm itself the source of slowness (I've spent a good while optimizing it and manually unrolling all of the loop stages using pre-processor directives etc)?</p>

<p>I've read about memory coalescing on the hardware, is that my issue? :S</p>

<p>Any advice at all appreciated!  If I've missed anything important please let me know and I'll update.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance! ;)</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: 16,777,216 is the device maximum reported workgroup size; 256**3. The global array of boolean values is one boolean.  It's set to false at the start of the kernel enqueue, then a branching statement sets this to true if a collision is found only - will that force a convergence? passwordLen is the length of the current input value and target hash is an int[4] encoded hash to check against.</p>
","<p>Your 'maximum flattened global worksize' should be multiplied by passwordLen. It is the number of kernels you can run, not the maximal length of an input array. You can most likely send much more data than this to the GPU.</p>

<p>Other potential issues: the 'generating blocks of candidate data to hash in a threaded fashion on the CPU', try doing this in advance of the kernel iterations to see whether the delay is in the generation of the data blocks or in the processing of the kernels; your sha1 algorithm is the other obvious potential issue. I'm not sure how much you've really optimised it by 'unrolling' the loops, usually the bigger optimisation issue is 'if' statements (if a single kernel instance within a workgroup tests to true then all of the lockstepped workgroup instances must follow that branch in parallel).</p>

<p>And DarkZeros is correct, you should manually play with the local workgroup size making it the highest common multiple of the global size and the number of kernels which can be run at once on the card. The easiest way to do this is to round up the global work group size to the next multiple of the card capacity and use an external if{} statement in the kernel only running the kernel for global_id less than the actual number of kernels you want to run.</p>

There was written <code>SHA-1 Checksum</code> and its value given <code>f9b59d72413649d31e633207e31f456443e7ea0b</code>.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) What is the use of it?</p>
  
  <p>2) How to test and verify it on Window and linux?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can I also make SHA-1 Checksum of any file?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>1) What is the use of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, hashing is a one-way (irreversible) process that takes some input data and produces a string - typically in hexadecimal - of a fixed length that uniquely* identifies that particular input data.
This is very useful and has many applications but in your case, it's used to verify the integrity of files. A website uploads the hash of a file for the world to see and when the file is downloaded on your computer, you check whether or not the hash you calculate locally matches the hash displayed on the website. If they match, the file is intact but if they don't, the file on your computer is not identical to the file on the server - most likely because it was damaged/altered in transit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) How to test and verify it on Windows and Linux?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least on *nix systems, there are several ways of comparing hashes. Nothing is stopping you from manually checking every character of two hashes for equality - this is often fast when you simply want to check a single file. Anyway, most of the hashing programs have a <code>-c</code> option for this purpose that will output ""OK"" in case of a match. To manually input the hash and file and pipe both to sha1sum for comparison, do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""672d844c60553f9b3db9844dc29ddf49bc426f45"" /bin/echo | sha1sum -c -
/bin/echo: OK
</code></pre>

<p>To calculate the hash and make a file (echo.sha1) containing the hash and file path + file name:</p>

<pre><code># calculate hash and write it along with the file path + file name to a file
$ sha1sum /bin/echo &gt; echo.sha1

# see the contents of the file
$ cat echo.sha1 
672d844c60553f9b3db9844dc29ddf49bc426f45  /bin/echo

# do the comparison
$ sha1sum -c echo.sha1 
/bin/echo: OK
</code></pre>

<p>Microsoft apparently provides <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/841290#bookmark-4"" rel=""nofollow"">The File Checksum Integrity Verifier</a> for the same purpose. I'm on Linux and haven't tested it but the description says:</p>

<p><em>""The File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV) is a command-prompt utility that computes and verifies cryptographic hash values of files. FCIV can compute MD5 or SHA-1 cryptographic hash values. These values can be displayed on the screen or saved in an XML file database for later use and verification.""</em></p>

<p>I disagree with Microsoft's use of the phrase <em>""cryptographic hash""</em> in this context; maybe the program is outdated. Anyway, for the record, <strong>MD5 and SHA1 are not cryptographically secure hashing algorithms</strong>. They are, however, perfectly fine for doing quick file integrity checks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I also make SHA-1 Checksum of any file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can indeed. In fact, there's no way of verifying file integrity <em>without</em> calculating the hash on your computer - its part of the process. 
To get the sha1 sum of a file on Linux/Unix (in this case the ""echo"" binary again), you can simply do:</p>

<pre><code>$ sha1sum /bin/echo
672d844c60553f9b3db9844dc29ddf49bc426f45  /bin/echo
</code></pre>

<p>There are other SHA hash lengths:</p>

<pre><code>$ sha512sum /bin/echo 
1f481804f114677efbfc1438b04e88af5be8507e098792b714939fcd346b7477fdb4ae0c53fd48e96d1031fc8d6e3d8c8d4c4c80e121f5c5a39d18c912b33a11  /bin/echo
</code></pre>

<p>MD5 was used for the same purpose for a long time and sometimes still is (but, again, don't use MD5 or SHA1 for cryptography):</p>

<pre><code>$ md5sum /bin/echo 
482a44200637097351e30c80b1155c27  /bin/echo
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see below, it works for strings as well. The <code>-n</code> option after <code>echo</code> strips out the newline character that would otherwise be part of the string and result in a wrong hash.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo -n ""some_string"" | sha256sum
539a374ff43dce2e894fd4061aa545e6f7f5972d40ee9a1676901fb92125ffee  
</code></pre>

<p>If you run a server and want to do password logins, you typically don't store the actual passwords but, instead, you store a hash of the passwords. In this case, add a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29"" rel=""nofollow"">salt</a> to the password before hashing and use the currently recommended hashing algorithm - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""nofollow"">bcrypt</a> is a good choice in 2016.</p>

<p>I could go on and on about checksums vs. cryptographic hashing vs. encryption, rainbow tables, hash collisions, etc. but that's beyond the scope of your question.</p>

<p>You need to use <a href=""https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Shining Light's Win32OpenSSL</a> or build OpenSSL yourself.</p>

<p>If you use Shining Light's version, everything is already built. While Thomas Hruska keeps Win32OpenSSL up to date with OpenSSL releases, I don't think he offers anything compatible with the version of C++ Builder 6 (circa 2002) you are using.</p>

<p>If you want to build OpenSSL from sources on the Win32 platform, then see <code>INSTALL.W32</code> and <code>INSTALL.W64</code> in the root directory of the OpenSSL distribution.</p>

<p>I believe you have a third option. That option is to grab a modern IDE. Microsoft offers a trial version of <a href=""http://www.visualstudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Visual Studio</a> (the link for the Trial is on the right of the page). Embarcadero also offers a free trial version of <a href=""http://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder"" rel=""nofollow"">C++ Builder XE5</a>. Both should work with Shining Light's Win32OpenSSL.</p>

","<p>the 2 hex characters you are converting to decimal will be in the range of 0-255. you mod that by 50 and add 1 making 1-6 (range(0-5)+1) occur 6 times over 1-256 while every other number occurs only 5 times. This would account for a ~20% increase in those numbers coming up.</p>

","<p>You get 1-6 more often because you fetch two hexadecimal digits from the hash. That's one byte, so it can store values from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. Then you use modulo <code>50</code>. In result you get ranges <code>0-49</code>, <code>50-99</code>, <code>100-149</code>, <code>150-199</code>, <code>200-249</code> and... <code>250-255</code>. This last one is responsible for extra prevalence of 1-6 in your results.</p>

<p>Solution: just use <code>mt_rand(1,50);</code></p>

<p>[edit]</p>

<p>If you really need to convert a number from 0-255 range to 1-50 range, the solution would be scaling and rounding.</p>

"50321301","How To Hash Social Security Numbers When Used As Identifiers","<p>I have a service that let's users store information (such as messages, videos', etc.) for their extended family online to be shared when they pass away. Ex - Send this video to my nephew when I pass way telling him I love him. </p>

<p>I have a JSON structured database that stores a users social security number as an identifier to their profile. </p>

<pre><code> $salted_hashed_ssn: {
    //important information for extended family such as vidoes and email addresses
   }
</code></pre>

<p>When a user dies, their closest family members go to my site and input the deceased person's social security number. I then hash those and see if a match is made in my database. If a match is made, we then run functions to share the important information for the extended family. </p>

<p>Preparing for the worst, I want to store the social security numbers as securely as possible. Because I only need to use the social security numbers as a identifier, I don't have to store the raw/plain text ssn values. Therefore, I can hash the ssns but I need to salt them to protect against lookup tables. My issue is that when the users input the deceased user's social security number I don't have a way to see which salt key was used. </p>

<p>To make it random and prevent against lookup tables, how would you recommend I salt my social security numbers? Should I just take x number of characters each time? Ie - always grab the first 4 characters of the social security number, hash those, and them to the full SSN and then rehash?</p>

<p>let salted_hashed_ssn = SHA256(First 4 characters of SSN) + SHA256(SSN) ?</p>

<p>How would you recommend setting up the salt and hash?</p>
","<p>You can treat your SSN in the same way you would treat a password.  Remember, a salt doesn't have to be secret, it just has to be <strong>different</strong> for each entry.  So simply store your salt alongside your hash, this is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend using SHA256 here, however.  Use <code>bcrypt</code> instead.  It handles the salt for you, which means you don't need to worry about the advice above anyway.  It's also far more resistant to brute forcing.  The SHA family was not designed for hashing in the way you are using it.</p>

<pre><code>// Hash a new password for storing in the database.
// The function automatically generates a cryptographically safe salt.
$hashToStoreInDb = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

<p>I created two programs, a client and a server, that communicate via socket in Java.
Now the problem is, when I receive an object from an InputStream on the server's socket, I have to take the SHA384 of the value received and check to ensure it is the same as the SHA384 computed by the client. I checked in debug mode that the received value is the same as the sent value, but when I take the SHA384 of this value I obtain a different hash than the client.</p>

<p>Why? The client is an android application and the server side is in simple Java.</p>

","<p>Minor issue: for <code>Strings</code>, you rely on <code>getBytes()</code>, which uses the system's default charset.  The result can be different if the client and server use different default charsets.  You should instead use <code>getBytes(String)</code>, specifying an appropriate charset name:</p>

<pre><code>return ((String) obj).getBytes('UTF-8');
</code></pre>

<p>But the major issue is that you use <code>ObjectOutputStream.writeObject()</code> to create your byte sequence for non-strings.  There is no particular reason to expect that that method will yield byte-for-byte identical byte sequences when applied to any two distinct objects, even if those objects are equivalent in some relevant sense.  You might get that result for objects of some classes, but I can definitely write a class whose instances will not have that property.</p>

<p>Oh, and your method will break if you pass it an object that isn't <code>Serializable</code>.</p>

","<p>Summary: In your Perl script, <code>-n</code> is being treated as an argument to include in the output of <code>echo</code>, not a flag to suppress the newline. ( Try </p>

<pre><code>$hash = `echo -n 'abcd'`;
</code></pre>

<p>to confirm). Use <code>printf</code> instead.</p>

<hr>

<p>Perl uses <code>/bin/sh</code> to execute code in back tics. Even if <code>/bin/sh</code> is a link to <code>bash</code>, it will behave differently when invoked via that like. In POSIX mode,</p>

<pre><code>echo -n 'abcd'
</code></pre>

<p>will output</p>

<pre><code>-n abcd
</code></pre>

<p>that is, the <code>-n</code> option is not recognized as a flag to suppress a newline, but is treated as a regular argument to print. Replace <code>echo -n</code> with <code>printf</code> in each script, and you should get the same SHA hash from each script.</p>

<p>(UPDATE: <code>bash</code> 3.2, when invoked as <code>sh</code>, displays this behavior. Newer versions of <code>bash</code> seem to continue treating <code>-n</code> as a flag when invoked as <code>sh</code>.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Even better, don't shell out to do things you can do in Perl.</p>

<pre><code>use Digest::SHA;

$hash = Digest::SHA::sha256('abcd');
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>For the curious, here's what the POSIX spec <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html"">has to say</a> about <code>echo</code>. I'm not sure what to make of XSI conformance; <code>bash</code> <code>echo</code> requires the <code>-e</code> option to treat the escape characters specially, but nearly every shell&mdash;<em>except</em> old versions of <code>bash</code>, and then only under special circumstances&mdash;treats <code>-n</code> as a flag, not a string. Oh well.</p>

<pre><code>The following operands shall be supported:

string
A string to be written to standard output. If the first operand is -n, or
if any of the operands contain a &lt;backslash&gt; character, the results are
implementation-defined.

On XSI-conformant systems, if the first operand is -n, it shall be treated
as a string, not an option. The following character sequences shall be

\b

\c

<p>Way1: Just call SHA256 method like below</p>

<p><code>SHA256((unsigned char*)buffer_to_hash, buffer_size, hashed_payload);</code></p>

<p>Way2: Use SHA256_CTX, SHA256_Init, SHA256_Update and SHA256_Final. As mentioned here
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2262386/generate-sha256-with-openssl-and-c/2458382#2458382"">generate sha256 with openssl and C++</a></p>

<p>Both the programs produce the same result</p>

<p>Example for both methods have been mentioned <a href=""http://www.askyb.com/cpp/openssl-sha256-hashing-example-in-cpp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>
","<p>Modulo bugs and such, the two have basically different intents. The first does batch style processing. That is to say: you give it one complete string, and it produces a hash of that complete string.</p>

<p>The second does hashing incrementally. If you don't have (or want) access to the entire string to be hashed at once, it allows you to read some data, operate on it, read some more, operate on it, and so on until you've read all the data. At the end, you can get the overall hash of the entire data stream.</p>

<p>Just for example, let's assume you're running this on a computer with 4 Gigs of RAM, and you want to hash a 16 gigabyte file. Since the data won't fit in RAM (or even close to it) the second is probably a better choice for this case. Likewise, if you're receiving data over the network, but don't (necessarily) want to store all the raw packets just so you can hash them and (for example) acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>OpenSSL 1.0.1 has SHA256 that I'd like to use. The method itself in the OpenSSL lib C code:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char *SHA256(const unsigned char *d, size_t n, unsigned char *md)
{

    OPENSSL_cleanse(&amp;c, sizeof(c));
    return (md);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>The function itself returns a pointer, and as parameters it needs the input data, the length of the data to hash, and an object for the hash.</p>

<p>I'm wrapping it in the next way:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(DLLNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
public extern static IntPtr SHA256(byte[] data, long len, ref byte[] result);

Console.WriteLine(d.Length + "" "" + x + "" "" + r.Length + "" "" + Encoding.ASCII.GetString(r));

<p>And what i get for result: <strong><em><code>16 1838788744 1</code></em></strong>. The <code>d.Length</code> is 16 OK, I get the x as a pointer OK, the <code>r.Length</code> becomes 1 byte that is impossible.</p>

<p>If I don't <code>ref</code> the <code>byte[]</code> in the method just simply give it to it nothing changes in the variable <code>r</code>.</p>

<p>Thank you for the help in advance!</p>
","<p>After some dicovery of the OpenSSL C source and experimenting with C# pointers and Marshaling it turned out the <code>SHA256</code> method does not put the result hash in the variable <code>md</code>, but it returns a pointer to the hash.

<p>The working C# code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(DLLNAME, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]

<p>Since we are not using the 3rd variable of the <code>SHA256</code> method (we just pass <code>null</code> instead) the <code>ref</code> is needed to be removed from the <code>DllImport</code>.</p>

","<p>Check the encoding, make sure that the actual byte arrays that are used to compute the hash are equal. In .NET you use ASCII encoding and in Android iso-8859-1. This should not mater as the iso-8859-1 is natural extension of the ASCII encoding, but still, check the arrays.
Also try using this function for SHA1 digest on Android:</p>

    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e1) {
      Log.e(LOG_TAG, ""Error initializing SHA1 message digest"");
    }
    mdSha1.update(data);
    byte[] sha1hash = mdSha1.digest();
    return sha1hash;

<p>However, your input for the hash isn't quite that random.  <code>message_id</code> is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier"" rel=""nofollow"">globally unique identifier</a> which ""only"" has 5.3e+36 possible values, and the randomness depends on the implementation. According to the wiki link, the odds of a collision are about 50% at 4.2e+18 samples. Email addresses and dates are likely significantly higher than that.</p>

","<p>The issue is not with the <code>sha256</code> function, but with the <code>$HEX64</code> format. </p>

<p>When you used <code>lowcase</code> you actually do some harm to the <code>SHA256</code> result: you're not altering the hexadecimal representation, but you're actually altering the characters themselves, which means your result isn't accurate - and then you're displaying them with <code>$HEX64.</code> which will always show capital letters for the hexadecimal characters.</p>

<p>What instead you want, presumably, is to store the lower case version of the <code>$HEX64.</code> format.  You can do that with <code>put</code>:</p>

<pre><code>data want;
  set have;
  source = catt(first,last,dob,sex);
  encryp = sha256(source);
  lower  = lowcase(put(encryp,$HEX64.));

<p>Note what <code>encryp</code> looks like - something totally different, and probably not particularly useful.  You can of course skip that step if you want.</p>

thanks</p>
","<p>This approach is expensive, since, every time you run this query, MySQL will have to examine every single record in <code>clients</code> and compute the SHA-1 hash of its <code>id</code> and <code>key</code>. (I'm assuming here that <code>clients</code> has more than a few rows, or at least, that you'd like to use an approach that supports the case where <code>clients</code> has more than a few rows.)</p>

<p>Why don't you add a new field called (say) <code>id_key_sha1</code>? You can use a <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-trigger.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">trigger</a> to keep the field populated, and add an <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">index</a> on it. This approach should perform <em>much</em> better.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> You mention that the client, in addition to passing in this SHA-1 hash, also has to submit a username and password? I don't know what your table structure looks like, but I'm guessing that it would make more sense to find the client record based on the username first, and then comparing the SHA-1 hash for that specific record, rather than trying to find the record by the SHA-1 hash.</p>

","<p>What you are probably misunderstanding is where the hashing algorithms are used. The first one is used during the creation of the signature <em>over</em> the certificate. The second one is the hashing algorithm that is used during signing with the private key that belongs to the certificate. That one seems to default to SHA-256.</p>

<p>Note that Microsoft is actually confusing hashing algorithms with signature algorithms. Maybe that once made some sense when everybody was still only using PKCS#1 v1.5 style signatures, but now it just makes them look stupid.</p>

The database server version is Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and i dont have permissions to make changes to the database. The password column of the database is set to varchar(50) and a digest is 48 characters. The only information that i have for the passwords is that they have been hashed with sha-256 algoritm but as far as i know a sha-256 digest is 64 characters and not 48. Is it possible to produce the same 48 length digests with sha256?</p>
","<p>The only two primitive hash functions with native output size of 192 bits (48hex * 1byte/2hex * 8bit/byte) are HAVAL-192 and TIGER-192. None of the others match up exactly.</p>

<p>If they have indeed been hashed with sha256, then they may be truncated (as a hex encoded sha-256 digest is 64 characters.</p>

<p>To deduce the exact situation will take some work. Here are the different ways you can approach it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I had access to the original source code, I'd look at that. Considering you asked the question, I'll assume that's not possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If I could write a record into the old system, I'd set a sentinel password (or find an account I knew the password to). Something that I know. Then I'd find the hashed result from the DB.</p>

<p>So now we know <code>p=password</code> and <code>h=4d9e...</code>. </p>

<p>From there, start by just hashing the password with sha256 and see what you come up with. If you're lucky, you'll find a pattern quickly (like the last half of the hash is just cut off). If you're not lucky, it'll take some digging and trial and error.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>p = ""password""

<p>And so on.</p></li>
<li><p>If I didn't have access to a known password, there would be no way of testing the hypothesis. So if you don't have the source code, and don't know an account in the system, you're basically out of luck. So make those first 2 your top priority.</p></li>

","<p>Usually database systems do not support this kind of hash functions on their own. It would be difficult to write the queries anyway, because the password hashes are not searchable. To verify a password with its hash-value following steps are necessary:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search for the row by username (cannot be done by the hash-value).</li>
<li>Return the password-hash from the found row.</li>
<li>Extract the used salt and the cost factor from the stored password-hash.</li>
<li>Build a new hash-value from the entered password with the same salt and cost factor.</li>
<li>Compare the stored hash-value and the new calculated one.</li>
</ol>

<p>That means, you first have to know the stored hash-value, before you can verify the entered password with it. Such a hash function is surely better placed in the development language, than in the database, especially when you later have to switch the algorithm or the cost factor and need backwards compatibility.</p>

","<p>Not C#, but here's how you can calculate a git commit hash from the bash prompt:</p>

<pre><code>commit_len=$(git cat-file commit HEAD | wc -c)
(echo -ne ""commit $commit_len\0""; git cat-file commit HEAD) | sha1sum

","<p>SHA-1 vs. SHA-2 is completely unrelated to the problem you have.

<p>How to implement or switch to SHA-2 certificate for email notifications?</p>
","<p>Although, SHA1 is more resistant than MD5 to collision attacks, but it is getting weaker each year. Therefore, google encourages to migrate away from SHA-1 to SHA-2/SHA-3.  </p>

<p>I think you should first acquire a SHA-2 certificate, and then use the following sample code to set it for SMTPClient:</p>

<pre><code>string certificate = ""Certificate.cer"";

X509Certificate cert = new X509Certificate2(certificate);

MailMessage message = new MailMessage(from, to);

SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(server);

client.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);

client.Send(message);

<blockquote>
  <p>The Framework caches SSL sessions as they are created and attempts to reuse a cached session for a new request, if possible. When attempting to reuse an SSL session, the Framework uses the first element of ClientCertificates (if there is one), or tries to reuse an anonymous sessions if ClientCertificates is empty.</p>

"16542910","Why does opening an MS Excel file change the SHA hash of a document?","<p>I want to verify that the contents of an Excel document have not been altered. I was thinking about using SHA hashes to do this. However, just the process of opening an Excel document changes the SHA hash of the file.</p>

<p>What is Excel 2011 changing in the file? Is there some way of preventing this from happening?</p>
","<p>I've just tested this quickly and if you set the file to be read-only, it does more or less what you want.</p>

<pre><code>Create spreadsheet, save, set as read-only
Generate SHA-1 hash -&gt; hash1

Open spreadsheet, edit, attempt save, receive warning about read-only copy, abort save, close without saving
Generate SHA-1 hash -&gt; hash1 (i.e. same hash as before)

Turn off read-only flag, open, edit, save, undo edit, save, close
Generate SHA-1 hash -&gt; hash2 (i.e. different hash from before)
</code></pre>

<p>So if you mark the file as read-only, this should allow people to view it without affecting the hash. If they turn the read-only flag off and open it, even if they do not make any changes, the hash will change.</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate_pub.crt
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have any examples of how I could sign JWT with a SHA256 cert?</p>
","<p>With additional info, that private key file is <strong>PEM but NOT PKCS#8</strong>, as a modern version of OpenSSL should have created for <code>req -newkey</code>. And the difference between PEM and ""DER"" (binary) which standard Java requires is not just removing (and adding) the BEGIN and END lines.</p>

<p>Your simplest solution if OpenSSL is available is to convert <em>both</em> of these, without encrypting:</p>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der -in private.pem -out good.der 
</code></pre>

<p>Then read <code>good.der</code> (use better name if you like) as bytes, and put that in <code>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec</code> and use it as you posted. Aside: you don't need to fiddle with <code>DataInputStream</code>, which isn't really intended for ""plain old"" bytes; <code>java.nio.file.Files.readAllBytes</code> can open, allocate, and read for you.</p>

<p>The next more complicated alternative is to convert to PKCS#8 but still PEM: same as about but omit <code>-outform der</code> (and use a file name that indicates PEM, to avoid confusion). Then in Java read <em>that</em> file as <em>characters</em> (with a <code>Reader</code>, usually <code>BufferedReader</code>, not a <code>Stream</code>), discard the <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> lines, concatenate all the lines between, and convert them from base64 to <code>byte[]</code>: in Java8 you have <code>java.util.Base64</code>, before that you can use <code>javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter</code>. </p>

<p>To read the file you have in standard Java is harder. You could read the PEM-armored PKCS#1 and convert to binary PKCS#1, then ""wrap"" the PKCS#1 into PKCS#8 by building the DER encoding, but that's a good bit more complicated than what you've demonstrated familiarity with. Or you could parse the PKCS#1 and use the components to construct your own implemenation of <code>RSAPrivateCrtKey</code> and use that directly (no factory), ditto. </p>

<p>The other alternative is to use the third-party library from <a href=""http://www.BouncyCastle.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.BouncyCastle.org</a> which has more flexible features for handling PEM files than standard Java. But you need to learn their API as well as the standard one, and if your program will run anywhere else you need to ensure BC is deployed with or as part of your program.</p>

"6994263","Encryption: do I need to salt the key when not even storing it at all?","<p>I searched all over the Net, including here on SO: There is a lot of discussion on the need to salt passwords before hashing and storing them.</p>

<p>In case the password is used to compute a key used for encryption (""Password Based Encryption""): what if you do not store the password at al?</p>

<ul>
<li>[Note: I <em>did</em> read SO: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1905112/passphrase-salt-and-iv-do-i-need-all-of-these"">Passphrase, Salt and IV, do I need all of these?</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1949640/does-iv-work-like-salt"">Does IV work like salt</a> are certainly a related question: I am not sure how the Initialization Vector discussed there relates to the question here]</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Suppose:</em></p>

<p>For encryption</p>

<ol>
<li>the users enters a master password</li>
<li>this is SHA256 hashed and the output is used to AES256 encrypt a file</li>
<li>the hash is <em>not</em> stored (and obviously neither is the master password)</li>
</ol>

<p>For decryption</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>The users enters the master password</li>
<li>This is SHA256 hashed and the output is used to decrypt the file</li>
<li>If the decryption was successful, the password was - apparently - correct</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> </p>

<p>When not storing anything except the encrypted file itself, is there any benefit in salting the master password before hashing it?</p>

<p><em>Considerations:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>it would probably reduce the likelihood of a hash-collision</li>
<li>it would require the salt to be stored.</li>
<li><p>if the salt were lost/corrupted the user would not be able to decrypt the file anymore</p></li>
<li><p>how to check for successful decryption in step3: does this require part of the file contents to be known?</p></li>
<li>if so, how much of a faux-pas is storing a known value in an encrypted file (this cannot always be prevented - an attacker might guess that for example the users last name is encrypted somewhere in the file - an be correct).</li>
</ul>
","<p>If you are not storing the master password then there is no need to salt it.  If you are reusing the master password to generate a lot of single-use passwords then it will need to be stored encrypted and decrypted as required.</p>

<p>Salting is for long term storing of user passwords that have to be matched more than once so that people with the same password don't have the same hash, which would help an attacker who stole the file.</p>

<p>Salt is for hashing in long term storage, an IV is for encryption using CBC mode (or CTR mode where it can also be called a nonce).</p>

<p>As to checking that your file has decrypted correctly, just ensure that you use a padding like PKCS7.  When the last block is decrypted the padding will be checked to ensure it is in the right format.  If the decryption failed then the padding will not be correctly formatted and you should get a ""Padding failed"" error.</p>

<ul>
<li>sha1 instructions: SHA1RNDS4, SHA1NEXTE, SHA1MSG1, SHA1MSG2; </li>
<li>sha-256 instructions: SHA256RNDS2, SHA256MSG1, SHA256MSG2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I am curious, Do any of the APIs/Libraries already exist that are able to laverage these instruction for ultra fast hashing to be used in PHP or other server side languages, when you use AMD RyZen CPU ?</strong> 
If not, when should we expect it to be available ?</p>

<p>Since Intel has provided specification for hardware SHA around year 2013, it seems at least a couple of compilers must have provied support for it.</p>

2015      for TLS encrypt.

<p>So, with enabled hardware and recent openssl, any php/python library which uses openssl to compute SHA256 may use hardware accelerated SHA256 digest computation (if enabled in the openssl and if this implementation will be selected by the library). And command-line too: <code>openssl dgst -sha256 -binary file_to_be_hashed</code>.</p>

<p>There are some raw bindings of openssl library in php: <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-digest.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-digest.php</a> and OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256 is there since PHP 5.5: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12174519/which-openssl-version-support-for-sha256-in-php"">which openssl version support for sha256 in php</a></p>

<p>For any given input, there's a lot (infinite in fact) different inputs that would yield the same hash. This is easy to realize since the output has a fixed size, but the input doesn't have size restrictions. </p>

<p>To achieve this, irreversible math is used. For instance, it is easy to calculate <code>10%3</code>. The answer to that is simply <code>10%3=1</code>. But if I give you the equation <code>x%3=1</code>, what would you do? This equation is true for all <code>x=3*k+1</code>. Thus, you cannot get the number I started with. </p>

<p>Another example of irreversible math is sine and cosine. For instance, <code>cos(0)=1</code>, but there are more input values that evaluates to 1. Actually, <code>cos(n*2pi)=1</code>. There are ""inverses"" to these functions, but they either gives an answer in a certain range or a multivalued answer. A third example is <code>x²=1</code>. This is true for both <code>x=1</code> and <code>x=-1</code>. However, in this example you get a finite (and also rather small) number of possible answers.</p>

<p>When dealing with encryption, one could say that the private key is used to pick the right solution. You can always quite trivially decrypt an encrypted message, but you will get a huge load of possible answers. The key is used to find the right one, rather than actually decrypting. </p>

"47017606","Is hashing really a irreversible process?","<p>I've been using hash and RSA for a time(on a very superficial level, for ex: RSA authentication on a SSH connection), and I want to learn more about it.</p>

<p>To begin with, I know that encryption is a two-way process that can be reverted. And hashing is a one-way process that is irreversible.</p>

<p>That last point just doesn't make sense to me, if I use an algorithm to hash ""hello"", wouldn't the same algorithm, but ""reversed""(meaning, it works ""backwards""), be able to convert that hash to ""hello"" again.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Thanks to @GeorgDangl, @klutt, and Pete Kirkham for pointing out that I didn't understand at all the concept of ""irreversible math"". The examples were really helpful.</p>
","<p>Trivial example - say that for our irreversible function, we take the number we are input and return the value modulo 7. </p>

<pre><code>   hash( 0) =&gt; 0
   hash( 1) =&gt; 1
   hash( 2) =&gt; 2
   hash( 3) =&gt; 3
   hash( 4) =&gt; 4
   hash( 5) =&gt; 5
   hash( 6) =&gt; 6

   hash(10) =&gt; 3
   hash(12) =&gt; 4
   hash(13) =&gt; 5
   hash(14) =&gt; 6
</code></pre>

<p>so if the hash value is 6, you don't know if the input was 6, or 14, or any value of 6 + 7 * N where N is an integer.</p>

","<p>Generally when being displayed to a user the output of a hash is displayed encoded as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal"" rel=""nofollow"">hexadecimal</a> string, sometimes you might also see a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"" rel=""nofollow"">Base64</a> string, but this is more rare.</p>

<p>The output of an MD5 hash is a 16 byte (128-bit) value . The full range of values a single byte can have can be shown as a two digit hexadecimal value. This hexadecimal value can range from 00 to FF which in decimal is 0 to 255 or perhaps more clearly in binary 00000000 to 11111111 (eight bits in a byte).</p>

<p>So 16 bytes can be represented as 32 hexadecimal digits without losing any information, and has the advantage of being easy to compare by visual inspection.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another source of confusion may be in your premise that hashes work on alphanumeric data, which is incorrect. Hashes such as MD5 do not operate on strings, they operate on arbitrary data. </p>

<p>When you hash a string it is hashed as data using an encoding such as UTF-8. For instance, the representation of <code>hello</code> in UTF-8 is <code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111</code> in binary or <code>68 65 6C 6C 6F</code> in hexadecimal.

<p>But the real reason for using Base16 is so that all the characters are printable/visible and none of them are control characters (regardless of the character set and encoding) or quote characters used as literal string delimeters in programming languages and document formats. This lets them pass through many contexts as is, without breaking any rules of the context.</p>

<p>There are other ways of achieving that goal. One is Base64. </p>

","<p>You are correct that SHA-512 returns a 64 byte value. However, in your database, you're storing a <em>hexadecimal string representation</em> of that 64 byte value, which requires twice as many bytes.</p>

<pre><code>final KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""DSA"");
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>final KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""ECDSA"");
</code></pre>

<p>The keys are much shorter than DSA - and I'm sure hex version signature would be shorter. I suggest you use a prime ECC curve of say 256 or 128 bits.</p>

<p>I am also calculating an HMAC-SHA384 code for the message.  From my reading it sounds as though HMAC-SHA384 <strong>does</strong> need byte-swapping if the transmission endianness (big-endian in my case) does not match machine endianness.  The swapping should occur from byte 0 and 47, 1 and 46, so on?  Can anyone more knowledgeable in the subject than I confirm or contradict this please?</p>

<p>I am presently using the .NET HMACSHA384 class, but on the other end I will be writing C++ code and don't yet know what library will provide the HMAC code.</p>
","<p>leppie is right, both are send as byte arrays. And you can be pretty sure that the byte array received will conform to NIST specifications and test vectors. So you should not overly worry about endianness in this case.</p>

<p>If there are people that need to worry then it is the implementors of the hash function. E.g. NIST unfortunately specified a little endian machine (Intel processor) as reference platform for SHA-3. The first version of Skein had incorrect test vectors because of a bug regarding endianness in the first iteration (1.0).</p>

<p><strong>How did I find that?</strong></p>

<p>I used <a href=""http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_csharp_online.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Online C# Tool</a> to create the hash of a string <code>""Hello""</code> using the code below:</p>

<pre><code>using System.IO;

{
    static void Main()
    {
        byte[] bytes = new UnicodeEncoding().GetBytes(""Hello"");
        String s =  Convert.ToBase64String(new SHA256Managed().ComputeHash(bytes));
        Console.WriteLine(s);
    }

<p>Above program produced the output <code>oH5Pc0MkbIKybzLlb4VBjVGNiy8trnfx1W/nr1Dbl68=</code></p>

<p>Then, I wrote a Ruby Program to compute Base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of string <code>""Hello""</code>, by encoding the string in all the supported char encodings of Ruby to figure out which char encoding will give exact same result.</p>

<pre><code>require ""digest/sha2""
require ""base64""
s = ""Hello""
Encoding.list.each { |e| puts ""Encoding: #{e.to_s} =&gt; Hash: #{Digest::SHA256.base64digest(s.encode(e)) rescue ""error""}""}
</code></pre>

<p>After running the program, I came to conclude that if you use <code>UTF-16LE</code> encoding, you will get exact same output.</p>

<pre><code>p hash = Digest::SHA256.base64digest(""Hello"".encode('UTF-16LE'))

<p>Then a Random String generator:</p>

<pre><code> private static Random random = new Random((int)DateTime.Now.Ticks);//thanks to McAden
 private string RandomString(int size)
    {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        char ch;

        {
            ch = Convert.ToChar(Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor(26 * random.NextDouble() + 65)));
            builder.Append(ch);
        }

        return builder.ToString();
    }

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1122483/c-sharp-random-string-generator"">Source</a></p>

<p>and now you can bruteforce for your combination:</p>

<pre><code>        string search = ""32"";
        string result = String.Empty;
        int slen = 5;
        string myTry = RandomString(slen);

        while (!result.EndsWith(search))
        {
            myTry = RandomString(slen);
            result = GetSHA1Hash(myTry);

        }

        MessageBox.Show(result + ""   "" + myTry);
</code></pre>

<p>This would search for a Hash String ending with 32. Happy Bruteforcing :)</p>

","<p>If you're playing around with tweaks to an algorithm, you shouldn't be using a built-in class implementing that algorithm. The class you mention is designed to implement standard algorithms for people who just want to use them in production; if you're <em>using</em> SHA-1 (or any cryptographic algorithm) instead of playing around and tweaking it, it's never a good idea to change the algorithm yourself (e.g. by changing the initial hash value), so the class does not support modifying those constants.</p>

<p>Just implement the algorithm yourself; from Wikipedia's pseudocode, it doesn't look like it's all that complicated. I know that ""don't implement your own crypto, use a standard and well-tested implementation"" is a common mantra here, but that only applies to production-type code -- if you're playing around with an algorithm to see what effect tweaking it has, you <em>should</em> implement it yourself, so you have more flexibility in modifying it and seeing the effect of the modifications.</p>

","<p>Basically adding to @Rahil's answer but too much for comments:</p>

<p>Even without API access, if <code>MessageDigest</code> were the implementation you could use reflection. But it's not. </p>

<p>Most of the java standard library is just commonly-useful classes in the usual way, e.g. <code>java.util.ArrayList</code> contains the implementation of ArrayList (or ArrayList&lt;?&gt; since 6), <code>java.io.FileInputStream</code> contains the implementation of FileInputStream (although it may use other classes in that implementation), etc. Java Cryptography uses a more complicated scheme where the implementations are not in the API classes but instead in ""providers"" that are mostly in their own jars (in JRE/lib and JRE/lib/ext) not rt.jar and mostly(?) don't have source in src.zip. </p>

<p>Thus the <code>java.security.MessageDigest</code> class does not have the code to implement SHA1, or SHA256, or MD5, etc etc. Instead it has code to search the JVM's current list of crypto providers to find an implementation of whatever algorithm is asked for, and instantiate and use that. Normally the list of providers used is set to (the list of) those included in the JRE distribution, although an admin or program can change it.
With the normal JRE7 providers, SHA1 is implemented by <code>sun.security.provider.SHA</code>.</p>

<p>In effect the API classes like <code>MessageDigest Signature Cipher KeyGenerator</code> etc function more like interfaces or facades by presenting the behavior that is common to possibly multiple underlying implementations, although in Java code terms they are actual classes and not interfaces.</p>

<p>This was designed back in 1990 or so to cope with legal restrictions on crypto in effect then, especially on export from the US. It allowed the base Java platform to be distributed easily because by itself it did no crypto. To <em>use</em> it -- and even if you don't do ""real"" crypto on user data in Java you still need things like verification of signed code -- you need to add some providers; you might have one set of providers, with complete and strong algorithms, used in US installations, and a different set, with fewer and weaker algorithms, used elsewhere. This capability is now much less needed since the US officially relaxed and in practice basically dropped enforcement about 2000, although there are periodically calls to bring it back. There is still one residual bit, however: JCE (in Oracle JREs) contains a policy that does not allow symmetric keys over 128 bits; to enable that you must download from the Oracle website and install an additional (tiny) file ""JCE Unlimited Strength Policy"".</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> don't try to alter the JCE implementation. As @cpast says, in this case where you want to play with something <em>different from</em> the standard algorithm, <em>do</em> write your own code.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sort</code> converts the hash to a sorted array of pairs (for the comparison of hashes with different keys order)</li>

","<h2>Use Marshal for Fast Serialization</h2>

<p>You haven't articulated a useful reason to change your data structure before hashing. Therefore, you should consider <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Marshal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">marshaling</a> for speed unless your data structures contain unsupported objects like bindings or procs. For example, using your <em>hash</em> variable with the syntax corrected:</p>

<pre><code>require 'digest/sha1'

hash = {
  foo: ""test"",
  bar: [1,2,3],
  hello: {
    world: ""world"",
    arrays: [
      {foo: ""bar""}
    ]
  }
}
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest Marshal.dump(hash)
#=&gt; ""f50bc3ceb514ae074a5ab9672ae5081251ae00ca""
</code></pre>

<p>Marshal is generally faster than other serialization options. If all you need is speed, that will be your best bet. However, you may find that JSON, YAML, or a simple #to_s or #inspect meet your needs better for other reasons. As long as you are comparing similar <em>representations</em> of your object, the internal format of the hashed object is largely irrelevant to ensuring you have a unique or unmodified object.</p>

"36695661","Flatten deep nested hash to array for sha1 hashing","<p>I want to compute an unique sha1 hash from a ruby hash. I thought about</p>

<ul>
<li>(Deep) Converting the Hash into an array</li>
<li>Sorting the array</li>
<li>Join array by empty string</li>
<li>calculate sha1</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the following hash:</p>

<pre><code>hash = {
  foo: ""test"",
  bar: [1,2,3]
  hello: {
    world: ""world"",
    arrays: [
      {foo: ""bar""}
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I get this kind of nested hash into an array like</p>

<pre><code>[:foo, ""test"", :bar, 1, 2, 3, :hello, :world, ""earth"", :arrays, :my, ""example""]
</code></pre>

<p>I would then sort the array, join it with <code>array.join("""")</code> and compute the sha1 hash like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'digest/sha1'
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest hash_string
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>How could I flatten the hash like I described above?</li>
<li>Is there already a gem for this?</li>
<li>Is there a quicker / easier way to solve this? I have a large amount of objects to convert (~700k), so performance does matter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Another problem that I figured out by the answers below are this two hashes:</p>

<pre><code>a = {a: ""a"", b: ""b""}
b = {a: ""b"", b: ""a""}
</code></pre>

<p>When flattening the hash and sorting it, this two hashes produce the same output, even when <code>a == b =&gt; false</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>The use case for this whole thing is product data comparison. The product data is stored inside a hash, then serialized and sent to a service that creates / updates the product data.</p>

<p>I want to check if anything has changed inside the product data, so I generate a hash from the product content and store it in a database. The next time the same product is loaded, I calculate the hash again, compare it to the one in the DB and decide wether the product needs an update or not.</p>
","<p>The question is how to ""flatten"" a hash. There is a second, implicit, question concerning <code>sha1</code>, but, by SO rules, that needs to be addressed in a separate question. You can ""flatten"" any hash or array as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>def crush(obj)
  recurse(obj).flatten
end

def recurse(obj)
  case obj
  when Array then obj.map { |e| recurse e }
  when Hash  then obj.map { |k,v| [k, recurse(v)] }
  else obj
  end
end

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<pre><code>crush({
  foo: ""test"",
  bar: [1,2,3],
  hello: {
    world: ""earth"",
    arrays: [{my: ""example""}]
  }
})
  #=&gt; [:foo, ""test"", :bar, 1, 2, 3, :hello, :world, ""earth"", :arrays, :my, ""example""]

crush([[{ a:1, b:2 }, ""cat"", [3,4]], ""dog"", { c: [5,6] }])
  #=&gt; [:a, 1, :b, 2, ""cat"", 3, 4, ""dog"", :c, 5, 6]

<p>In the Crypto++ <a href=""https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Pipelining"" rel=""nofollow"">Pipelining system</a>, filters and sinks are owned by the object they are attached to. They are automatically deleted by the destructor of that object.</p>

<p>And from ""Important Usage Notes"" in <a href=""http://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/master/Readme.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">ReadMe.txt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a constructor for A takes a pointer to an object B (except primitive types such as int and char), then A owns B and will delete B at A's destruction. If a constructor for A takes a reference to an object B, then the caller retains ownership of B and should not destroy it until A no longer needs it.</p>

<p>I want to hide the password in the encrypted format.In Burp Suite,the following vulnerability issue was displayed.
[![enter image description here][2]][2]</p>

<p>I am using sha-512 for encryption and the url is https. I have been searching on this but all I have found is just to change the protocol to https from http.Please help me how to solve this issue of hiding the form data from showing the password in the POST request header parameters.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>While submitting a form's data,the password is visible in encrypted format inside the form data and also in the parameters of the POST request</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the browser shows you all data that has been posted. Effectively the request has been done on behalve of user and you have to assume the user can see all information he/she has posted. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to hide the password in the encrypted format. <br/>
  just to change the protocol to https from http</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is the correct answer, https ensures the traffic is encrypted and server authenticated and anybody sniffing out the traffic would be unable to decrypt any of posted data. What you see in the browser are data before encryption and actual transmission.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am using sha-512 for encryption </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, seems you just hashed some data (please search and learn the difference between encryption and hashing), now the hash has became the password, now you need to protect the hash.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CWE-204</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing you've shown indicates the CWE-204 vulnerability. What you've shown is a normal post request and response with a session cookie and redirect url. Your system may or may not have the CWE-204 vulnerability, though it has nothing to do with the data you've provided.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please help me how to solve this issue of hiding the form data from showing the password in the POST request header parameters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there's a question:</p>

<p>Is the password provided by the user and do you want to hide the password from any 3rd party (potentially sniffing out the traffic)? Then using https will do the trick. The user may still see the posted data (including the password), but well - the user provided the password, he knows it already.</p>

<p>If the ""password"" some system parameter you want to pass in the form without the user able to know it? In theory - you may encrypt the password on the server-side and decrypt the password on the target system. However - the user may just post the encrypted password again. Then you may rather use time-limited JWT token.</p>

<p>Is it possible to decrypt this Hash with Swift 2 to the original String?</p>
","<p>SHA is a hash, not an encryption. A hash does not include all of the information in the original and it's a one-way function. It's a signature of the original data, not a version of it.</p>

<p>So no, it can not be undone to retrieve the original.</p>

<p>The only option to 'reverse' would be to create guesses of the original and try to hash them and see if the result matches. Note that hashes aren't unique, so even if you got a match you couldn't 100% guarantee that it matched the original, only that it hashes to the same value.</p>

<p>Also is the way I SHA the password correct?</p>
","<p>The problem is that your MySQL query is causing an error, which means that your <code>$result</code> doesn't actually contain a result resource.</p>

<p>You need to remove the <code>''</code> from around <code>SHA($password)</code> in your query, and instead put them around the password value, like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>$query=""SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password=SHA('$password')"";
</code></pre>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also is the way I SHA the password correct?</p>

<p>That depends on how the passwords were hashed when they were inserted into the database. MySQL's <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/encryption-functions.html#function_sha1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SHA()</code></a> is the same as its <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/encryption-functions.html#function_sha1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SHA-1()</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Calculates an SHA-1 160-bit checksum for the string, as described in RFC 3174</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is also the same as PHP's <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.sha1.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sha1()</code></a>; so, for example, if the passwords in the database are SHA-1 hashes that were created using PHP's <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.sha1.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sha1()</code></a>, it should be fine.</p>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37354199/verification-of-hashing-password-is-not-working-complete-code-shown"">Verification of Hashing password is not working</a></p>
","<p>To me this looks like an attempt to reimplement a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"" rel=""nofollow"">PBKDF2</a> algorithm, to get a cost factor.</p>

<p>Usually it is not recommended to make experiments with security functions, instead one should use a proven well tested algorithm. Your concern about the algorithm above is justified, try to convince your team to switch to <a href=""https://bcrypt.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BCrypt.Net</a> or to PBKDF2.</p>

<p>When you go for PBKDF2, then you can either use the built in dotnet class <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rfc2898derivebytes%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Rfc2898DeriveBytes</a> to calculate a PBKDF2 with HMACSHA1 (which is the standard even today), or you can use an implementation which supports other hash functions like <a href=""https://github.com/defuse/password-hashing"" rel=""nofollow"">PBKDF2 with SHA-256</a>.</p>

"7545431","Changing the hashing function on a pre-existing database","<p>I'm doing a bit of reading on hashing for passwords.  I've seen that SHA-256 > MD5.
This got me thinking about how an app may deal with changing from one hashing function to another.  What happens if someone implements an app that hashes their passwords using MD5.  They then decide that SHA-256 is the way to go.  But of course the password hashes stored in the database are in MD5. </p>

<p>What is the process for migrating the data in the database from one hashing function to another?</p>
","<p>It is not possible to ""unhash"" passwords (at least not in a general, efficient and reliable way -- you <em>can</em> guess some passwords, that's what attackers do, and you want to migrate from MD5 precisely because attackers may have some success at it). So the migration will be spread over time: some passwords will be hashed with MD5, other with SHA-256. When a password is to be verified:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the SHA-256 of that password is known, SHA-256 is used. This password is already migrated.</li>
<li>Otherwise, MD5 is used to check the password. If it matches, then the password is good, <em>and</em>, since the password is known by the app at that time, the app also hashes the password with SHA-256 and <em>replaces</em> the MD5 hash with the SHA-256 hash in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, passwords are migrated dynamically; to get totally rid of MD5, you have to wait a long time and/or destroy accounts which have not been accessed for a long time. You need to be able to distinguish a MD5 hash from a SHA-256 hash, which is easy since they have distinct sizes (16 bytes for MD5, 32 bytes for SHA-256). YOu could also add a flag or any other similar gimmick.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> that hashing passwords with a raw single application of a hash function is a pretty lousy way of doing it, security-wise, and replacing MD5 with SHA-256 will not really improve things. You hash passwords so that an attacker who gains read access to the database will not learn the passwords themselves. To <em>really</em> prevent the attacker from guessing the passwords, you also need ""salts"" (per-password random data, stored alongside the hashed password) and a suitably <em>slow</em> hash function (i.e. thousands, possibly millions, of nested hash function invocations). See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2772014/is-sha-1-secure-for-password-storage/2774744#2774744"">this answer</a> for details. The short answer: since you are envisioning migration, do the smart thing and migrate to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bcrypt</a>, not SHA-256 (see <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage/6415#6415"">that answer</a> on security.stackexchange).</p>

"19988785","Which is preferable: sha1_file(f) or sha1(file_get_contents(f))?","<p>I want to create a hash of a file which size minimum 5Mb and can extend to 1-2 Gb. Now tough choice arise in between these two methods although they work exactly same.</p>

<pre><code>Method 1: sha1_file($file)
Method 2: sha1(file_get_contents($file))
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried with 10 Mb but there is no much difference in performance.
<strong>But on higher data scale. What's better way to go?</strong></p>
","<p>Use the most high-level form offered unless there is a compelling reason otherwise.</p>

<p>In this case, the correct choice is <code>sha1_file</code>. Because <code>sha1_file</code> is a higher-level function that only works with files. This 'restriction' allows it to take advantage of the fact that the file/source can be processed as a stream<sup>1</sup>: only a small part of the file is ever read into memory at a time.</p>

<p>The second approach guarantees that 5MB-2GB of memory (the size of the file) is wasted/used as <code>file_get_contents</code> reads <em>everything</em> into memory before the hash is generated. As the size of the files increase and/or system resources become limited this can have a very detrimental effect on performance.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> The source for <code>sha1_file</code> can be <a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/hash/hash_sha.c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">found on github</a>. Here is an extract showing only lines relevant to stream processing:</p>

<pre><code>PHP_FUNCTION(sha1_file)
{       
    stream = php_stream_open_wrapper(arg, ""rb"", REPORT_ERRORS, NULL);
    PHP_SHA1Init(&amp;context);    
    while ((n = php_stream_read(stream, buf, sizeof(buf))) &gt; 0) {
        PHP_SHA1Update(&amp;context, buf, n);
    }    
    PHP_SHA1Final(digest, &amp;context);    
    php_stream_close(stream);
}
</code></pre>

<p>By using higher-level functions, the onus of a suitable implementation is placed on the developers of the library. In this case it allowed the use of a scaling stream implementation.</p>

<pre><code>// Create a buffer in which to write the bytes, making sure it's
// big enough for the size of the hash
let mut bytes = vec![0; seed.output_bytes()];
// Write the raw bytes from the hash into the buffer

<p>I don't know if it is possible to ignore parts of the log for the SCM revision parsing, otherwise you'll have to do some filtering on your side of the request. If the different revisions happen in order in the log, then you can choose to always discard the first or second one. </p>

The way to obtain a pESN from MEID is fairly simple in theory. For example, given MEID 0xA0000000002329, to make a pESN, SHA-1 needs to be applied to the MEID. SHA-1 on A0000000002329 gives e3be267a2cd5c861f3c7ea4224df829a3551f1ab. Take the last 6 hex numbers of this result, and append it to 0x80 - the result is 0x8051F1AB.</p>

<p>If these instructions are true, then how do I apply SHA-1 to my hex number byte by byte??</p>
","<p>You have a tiny little issue which is the consequence of using <code>BigInteger</code> to get your byte array. Since the MEID is only 7 bytes long, when you pump it through the BigInteger, you will get a byte array of length 8 because the BigInteger outputs the exta byte which holds the sign. This extra byte causes the SHA-1 hash of your input to be completely different, of course. You need to strip it off. </p>

<p>So here is what the HEX MEID to ESN code will look like:</p>

<pre><code>String hexMEID = ""A0000000002329"";
MessageDigest mDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance( ""SHA1"" );

byte[] input = new byte[ 7 ]; // MEIDs are only 7 bytes

// Now copy the bytes from BigInteger skipping the extra byte added by it
System.arraycopy( new BigInteger( hexMEID, 16 ).toByteArray(), 1, input, 0, 7 );

// Get the SHA-1 bytes
byte[] result = mDigest.digest( input );

// Build the SHA-1 String
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; result.length; i++ )
{
    String hex = Integer.toHexString( 0xFF &amp; result[ i ] );
    if ( hex.length() == 1 )
    {
        sb.append( '0' );
    }
    sb.append( hex );
}

String sha1 = sb.toString();
// Grab the last 6 characters of the SHA-1 hash
String lastSix = sha1.substring( sha1.length() - 6 );
// And prepend '80', now you have the ESN
System.out.println( ""80"" + lastSix );
// Will print 8051f1ab which is exactly what you want

<p>I am validating JWTs signed with <strong>RS256</strong> using the default C# JwtSecurityTokenHandler. In some cases, the validation fails when it shouldn't. Concretely, tokens from a given Authorization Server validate properly while tokens form another Authorization Server won't.</p>

<p>BUT... <strong>Using the same JWTs and RSA Certificates on JWT.IO validates ALL the tokens succesfully</strong>. This is the part that makes me believe that there's something wrong/unusual in the C# implementation. <strong>I am also able to validate the same JWTs using the same Certificates using the oidc-client JavaScript library</strong>. The one place where the validation sometimes fails is in C#.</p>

    SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create();
    byte[] hash = sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(tokenParts[0] + '.' + tokenParts[1]));

    RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter rsaDeformatter = new RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter(rsa);
    rsaDeformatter.SetHashAlgorithm(""SHA256"");

    var valid = rsaDeformatter.VerifySignature(hash, FromBase64Url(tokenParts[2]));
    Console.WriteLine(valid); // sometimes false when it should be true

private static byte[] FromBase64Url(string base64Url)

    return Convert.FromBase64String(base64);

  <p>Note that implementers have found that some cryptographic libraries
     prefix an extra zero-valued octet to the modulus representations they
     return, for instance, returning 257 octets for a 2048-bit key, rather
     than 256.  Implementations using such libraries will need to take
     care to omit the extra octet from the base64url-encoded
     representation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of one of the tokens you provided on a copy of this issue elsewhere, the decode of the modulus includes a prefixed 0x00 byte.  This causes downstream problems.  But you can fix their non-conformance.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] modulusBytes = FromBase64Url(modulus);

if (modulusBytes[0] == 0)

    modulusBytes = tmp;
}

<p>It looks like RS256 treats the signature as opaque bytes, so it will encode it as-is.  So you probably don't need this correction (though it's where my investigation started):</p>

<pre><code>byte[] sig = FromBase64Url(tokenParts[2]);

if (sig.Length &lt; modulusBytes.Length)

    byte[] tmp = new byte[modulusBytes.Length];

AFAIK the only way a hash can be different is due to a random salt, but according to the documentation I'm disabling salts by setting the salt size to 0.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args ) {
    char[] password = ""test_pass"".toCharArray();
    String str = encodePassword(password);

    System.out.printf(
        ""Byte digest '%s'\n"", 
        String.valueOf(Hex.encodeHex(Base64.decodeBase64(str)))
    );
}

static StandardByteDigester digester = new StandardByteDigester();
{
    digester.setAlgorithm(""SHA-256"");
    digester.setIterations(100000);
    digester.setSaltSizeBytes(0);
    digester.initialize();
}

public static String encodePassword(char[] rawPass) {
    return new String(Base64.encodeBase64(digester.digest(toBytes(rawPass))));
}

public static byte[] toBytes(char[] ch) { 
    Charset charset = Charset.defaultCharset();
    ByteBuffer buff = charset.encode(CharBuffer.wrap(ch));
    byte[] tmp = new byte[buff.limit()];
    buff.get(tmp);
    return tmp;    
}
</code></pre>
","<p>Your bug is related to the fact that you initialize your static field <code>StandardByteDigester digester</code> in an <strong>instance initializer block</strong> instead of a <strong>static initializer bloc</strong> such that it is never called as you never create an instance of your class so <strong>at the end it uses the default configuration</strong> with random salt.</p>

<p><strong>Try this:</strong></p>

<pre><code>static {
    digester.setAlgorithm(""SHA-256"");
    digester.setIterations(100000);
    digester.setSaltSizeBytes(0);
    digester.initialize();
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Your code could be simplified if your method <code>encodePassword</code> took a <code>String</code> instead of a <code>char</code> array as you could simply call <code>getBytes(Charset)</code> as next:</p>

<pre><code>public static String encodePassword(String rawPass) {
    return new String(
        Base64.encodeBase64(digester.digest(rawPass.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))),
        StandardCharsets.US_ASCII
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> It is not a good practice to rely on the platform's default charset as your code would then be platform's dependent so here as base 64 characters are all included in <code>US_ASCII</code>, let's use this charset to decode.</p>

","<p>You have at least two ways to create unique identifiers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use incremental value, usually integer, to generate unique key</li>
<li>Use eg. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Incremental identifiers</h2>

<p>The first choice is obvious: whether you do it on the database layer or on the application layer, you need to store information on which identifier was generated last, so you can generate another by incrementing it.</p>

<p>Example solution is here:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Incremental(object):
    _last_id = 0
    def __init__(self):
        Incremental._last_id += 1
        self.id = Incremental._last_id


&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClass(Incremental):
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'MyClass with id=%s' % self.id


&gt;&gt;&gt; a = MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b, c
(MyClass with id=1, MyClass with id=2, MyClass with id=3)
</code></pre>

<p>Although take a look at what others proposed - their proposals may be better suited when it comes to incremental IDs.</p>

<h2>Universally Unique Identifiers</h2>

<p>The second choice is just using proper tool for proper task: UUID is specifically designed to give you unique identifier.</p>

<p>There is a module called <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/uuid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">UUID</a> bundled with standard Python installation that you can use for this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import uuid
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(uuid.uuid1())
'0baa65ea-b665-11e1-b721-b80305056d6a'
</code></pre>

<h2>Translating them into hashes</h2>

<p>You can translate both values to SHA-1 hashes, if you wish:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import hashlib
&gt;&gt;&gt; hashlib.sha1(str(1)).hexdigest()
'356a192b7913b04c54574d18c28d46e6395428ab'
&gt;&gt;&gt; hashlib.sha1('0baa65ea-b665-11e1-b721-b80305056d6a').hexdigest()

","<p>If you have a parent class in which you declare a type, and 3 other classes which inherit after the parent class (children), then you can create a method which would be declared as returning the parent type, but inside you would return each of the child types. 
This will work and compile as the parent type will be automatically casted on to a child type.
It will not work the other way round however (you cannot cast a type from a child to parent). </p>

","<h1>Short answer</h1>

<p>It seems your SHA-256 hash algorithm implementation done in the Swift language is correct.</p>

<h1>Long answer</h1>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/43081507"">The Java example you are referring to</a> does not just contain the SHA-256 hash algorithm implementation, but also contains the HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm implementation to calculate the signature (?).</p>

<p>All in all, if there is a need of the SHA-256 algorithm only, please check the following <strong>draft</strong> Java implementation:</p>

class Program {
    public static void main(final String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Input.
        final String input = ""1234nonce=1234"";

        // Processing.
        final byte[] output = sha256(input);

        // Output.
        System.out.printf(""Signed output: %s.%n"", Arrays.toString(output));

        final List&lt;Integer&gt; unsignedOutput = unsignedIntStream(output)
            .boxed()
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.printf(""Unsigned output: %s.%n"", unsignedOutput);
    }

    private static IntStream unsignedIntStream(final byte[] array) {
        return IntStream
            .range(0, array.length)
            .map(index -&gt; Byte.toUnsignedInt(array[index]));
    }

    private static byte[] sha256(final String text) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        final MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
        return digest.digest(text.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Signed output: [-38, -49, -114, 73, 87, -21, -46, 73, -55, 67, 19, 33, 57, -110, 69, 48, 51, 56, 0, -44, -84, 114, 118, 31, 102, 19, -81, 51, -103, -26, -113, 67].

","<p>Hash algorithms are taking a bunch of bytes, calculate the hash and return a predefined number of bytes. So it doesn't matter to them, if the input is a short encoded text or a large binary file.</p>

<p>It depends on the implementation of the hash function and of the programming environment, how the string is converted to a byte array. As long as it is always done the same way, the hashes will be comparable. If you need a cross-platform hash, it is a good idea to first convert the string to a byte array (preferably UTF-8 encoded) and then feeding it to the hash.</p>

<p>The output is often a hexadecimal representation of the hash, but sometimes you can also request the binary output.</p>

","<p>Charles' answer is absolutely correct. However, I'm assuming that you don't want with the shortest binary encoding of the SHA256 bash - the 32-octet string - and want something printable and somewhat human-readable.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> However, this <em>does not</em> exactly apply to barcodes. At least QR codes encode <em>binary</em> data, so just use <code>digest()</code> method of your hash - that would be the most efficient encoding you can use there. Your QR code generation library should most likely support generating codes for ""raw"" binary strings - check your library docs and find the correct method/invocation.</p>

<p>SHA hashes (and other hashes) don't produce or operate on <em>characters</em>, they work with binary data. SHA-256 produces 256 bits of data, commonly represented with 32 bytes. In particular, in Python 3 you should notice that <code>hashlib.sha256(""..."").digest()</code> returns <code>bytes</code> and not <code>str</code>.</p>

<p>There is a convenience method <code>hexdigest</code>, that produces hexadecimal (base16) string that represents those bytes. You can use base32, base58, base64, <a href=""https://github.com/tsunaminoai/baseEmoji"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">baseEmoji</a> or any other encoding that fits your requirements.</p>

<p>Basically, your problem is actually ""I have a number and want a short encoding of it"". Decide on how many distinct characters you can use (encoding base) and use that. There are many libraries on PyPI that could help. <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-baseconv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">python-baseconv</a> may come handy.</p>

<p>The question is how many bits should I compute?  I have a sha-160 computation that gives me a 160 bit hash of my data, but I expect this is way larger than necessary.  So I'm thinking I could truncate the resulting hash down to say the low 40 bits and use that as a sufficiently large bit pattern that if the data gets corrupted, I will most likely detect it.</p>

<p>So the question is two fold, how many bits is good enough and is taking the lower bits of a sha-160 hash a good approach to take?</p>

<p>At the end, when ""a"" is hashed, it turns into this:</p>

<p>Instead of the actual hash (which is this):</p>

<pre><code>1F40FC92DA241694750979EE6CF582F2D5D7D28E18335DE05ABC54D0560E0F5302860C652BF08D560252AA5E74210546F369FBBBCE8C12CFC7957B2652FE9A75
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, why is it wielding such different results. Is it a problem with the bitwise operator functions? I am stumped.</p>
","<p>Here is a working implementation of SHA512 for Lua 5.1</p>

<p>File <strong>sha2for51.lua</strong></p>

<pre><code>-- This module contains functions to calculate SHA2 digest.
--    Supported hashes: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256
--    This is a pure-Lua module, compatible with Lua 5.1
--    It works on Lua 5.1/5.2/5.3/5.4/LuaJIT, but it doesn't use benefits of Lua versions 5.2+

--    Input data may must be provided either as a whole string or as a sequence of substrings (chunk-by-chunk).
--    Result (SHA2 digest) is a string of lowercase hex digits.
--
--    Simplest usage example:
--       local your_hash = require(""sha2for51"").sha512(""your string"")

--    See file ""sha2for51_test.lua"" for more examples.

<p>Now, <strong>Is it possible to have MD5 and SHA-0 colliosion in two Strings or Files at once?</strong></p>

<p>Here is an image showing a comparison table which i found while searching:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5IkHr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5IkHr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><em>Here, You can see in MD5 &amp; SHA-0, on both possible collisions are found.</em></p>

<p>Can anyone explain if it is possible to have both collisions at the same?</p>

<p><strong>I have got some example for MD5 Collisions. It would be better if someone can provide an example for MD5 &amp; SHA-0 Collision both at the same?</strong></p>
","<p>Collisions are possible in all hashes, it is a mathematical certainty. The reason it happens is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">Pigeonhole Principle</a>, what it means is you only have <code>X</code> possible values for the hash to have, once you hash <code>X+1</code> items, you are guaranteed to have a collision because you must have used every hash value at least once making the <code>X+1</code> item you hash a guaranteed collision.</p>

<p>Now, apply this logic to MD5 and SHA1. Pretend you have a very long hash which is just the MD5 hash (<code>2^128</code> possible hashes) concatenated  on to the SHA1 hash (<code>2^160</code> possible hashes). You still have only have <code>2^128 * 2^160</code> possible hashes, once you hash <code>2^128 * 2^160 + 1</code> items you are guaranteed to have a item that had a collision in MD5 and a collision in SHA1 at the same time.</p>

<p>Would such a hash be easily found so that you could do a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">second-preimage</a> attack so you could replace a existing hashed file with a 2nd one that had a matching hash? No, that attack would likely be unfeasible on the non-government level.</p>

"30481370","Does a git commit hash equal a repository state?","<p>Each git commit is attributed a hash which ""signs"" its content.
Does it also sign where the commit came from or is it just the commit data itself which is used for the hash calculation?</p>

<p>Differently phrased: is it impossible (apart from hash collisions) to forge a second repository with its head commit having the exact same hash and same content but the rest of the tree differing?</p>
","<p>The answer to the second question is yes (it is impossible, etc).</p>

<p>The first question is not as well formed as I think you might want, because a commit hash is in fact just based on the commit data.  The key that causes the <em>second</em> question's answer is that ""the commit data"" includes these key items, which you can see in an actual commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p HEAD
tree 22abd5c3fed5e2f49fb71e10b39d8c4929e51fc7
parent 4ebdeb68ba87282f87c39d790ba17fe1e021cc97
parent 9eabf5b536662000f79978c4d1b6e4eff5c8d785
[snip]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tree</code> line gives the hash of the tree (which depends only on the tree contents) and the <code>parent</code> lines—two, in this case, as <code>HEAD</code> is a merge commit—give the hashes of the parent commits.  Given that the hash of the current commit depends on the hash(es) of its tree and parent(s), if you were to construct a different repo with a different history or different tree, those would have different hashes so that the commit would also have a different hash.</p>

<p>After that, I do a bunch of other commits. Now, I sync my <code>feature</code> branch with <code>master</code>, so I do <code>git rebase master</code>. However, as <code>rebase</code> changes history, it changes the SHA of the referenced commit <code>389b04</code>, so the second commit now references a non-existing commit.</p>

<p>My question is: is it somehow possible to automatically fix such SHAs in commit messages while doing <code>rebase</code>? I know this could be solved by doing <code>merge</code> instead, but I'm wondering whether there is a way of doing this with <code>rebase</code>.</p>

","<p>These are the ways you can find our your password</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From the logs: If you have your logs intact, then you can find the password in the Android Studio log files : Go to ~/Library/Logs -> AndroidStudio ->idea.log.1 and search for Search for ""Pandroid.injected.signing.key.password"" and you can see the key password.

","<p>I changed my code a bit(code can be seen <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29416549/getting-hash-of-a-binary-file-c"">here</a>). The problem was I was storing checksum values in different forms. The checksum value from file is in plain text, while calculating the checksum would return an unsigned char. So I decided to convert the returned checksum value to its plain text reprsentation, and then compare them using <code>strncmp()</code>. As it can be seen <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29416549/getting-hash-of-a-binary-file-c"">here</a>.</p>

"34952935","Sha256 salted is there any chance to use rainbow tables to ""decrypt"" it?","<p>i want to ask is there any chance to use rainbow tables on salted hashes if we already know the salt. First of all i want to introduce the system of that hashes.</p>

<p>Each of this is computed using the SHA-256 hash of 3 distinct inputs.
First, is the server seed. This is a precomputed value generated some time in the past. Seeds are generated in a chain such that today's seed is the hash of tomorrow's seed.</p>

<p>seed 0 => seed 1 => seed 2 => seed 3</p>

<p>Next, the server seed is salted (scrambled) with the results of the New York Lottery's Take 5 game. Drawn daily at 11:21 pm EST, these results (0-padded) are appended to the server seed for use the following day.</p>

<p>Finally, each roll is salted with the unique round id ensuring a different hash each roll.</p>

<p>The round's hash is generated using SHA256(""serverseed-lottery-roundid""). Taking the first 8 hex digits of the resulting hash and converting to decimal yields an integer from 0-4294967295. Taking modulo 15 yields the final roll in the range 0-14.</p>

<p>And i add you few examples with these seeds and salts chronologically:
Seeds:</p>

<p>1# 08659e6ef7759d68c4a4d8b214217394c5f2b1a539cc51cc5f89be1f55ab737b</p>

  # the same leaf.

  # go into the training, testing, or validation sets, and we want to keep
  # existing files in the same set even if more files are subsequently
  # added.

","<p>This code is simply distributing file names “randomly” (but reproducibly) over a number of bins and then grouping the bins into just the three categories.  The number of bits in the hash is irrelevant (so long as it’s “enough”, which is probably about 35 for this sort of work).</p>

<p>Reducing modulo <em>n</em>+1 produces a value on [0,<em>n</em>], and multiplying that by 100/<em>n</em> obviously produces a value on [0,100], which is being interpreted as a percentage.  <em>n</em> being <code>MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS</code> is meant to control the rounding error in the interpretation to be no more than “one image”.</p>

<p>This strategy is reasonable, but looks a bit more sophisticated than it is (since there is still rounding going on, and the remainder introduces a bias—although with numbers this large it is utterly unobservable).  You could make it simpler and more accurate by simply precalculating ranges over the whole space of 2^160 hashes for each class and just checking the hash against the two boundaries.  That still notionally involves rounding, but with 160 bits it’s only that intrinsic to representing decimals like 31% in floating point.</p>

I am working on a file parsing application and there is a file entity in the DB with descendants and, in order to have a more compact foreign/primary key than the fully qualified path to a file, I would like to convert it into the shortest possible unique digest as possible.</p>

<p>What are my options to do this?  Can I use <code>SHA</code>?</p>

<p>How about if i just took an MD5 checksum out of the fully qualified path string and got something like 1736622845? On a command line, it can be done with </p>

<pre><code>echo -n '/my/path/filename' | cksum | cut -d' ' -f1 
</code></pre>

<p>Is that guaranteed to never repeat for two different inputs?  If yes, how would I translate the above <code>bash</code> piped command into pure Python so that I don't have to invoke a system call but get the same value?</p>
","<p>The shortest possible unique ID of a string is the string. 
You can try to use an alphabet that only contains the characters allowed in the path, so that you use less bits (a lot of work, not a lot of benefit, unless your paths really only contain a few characters)</p>

<p>What I think you want is a fairly good short hash function. As soon as you generate a hash function there's a risk of collision. For most hash functions a good rule of thumb is that you have far less entries than the hash value space. There's a theorem to prove that as soon as you have more than <code>sqrt(key_space)</code> entries you will (with the best hashes) get collisions half the time.</p>

<p>So if you take say 1000 paths, you should aim at having a hash pace of at least 1.000.000 entries to work with. You can chop up other hash functions (say take only the first 2 bytes of the md5). That should work, but note the increase in collisions (where 2 entries will generate the same value).</p>

<p>Also if you are so keen to save space, store the hash value in binary (large int). It's far shorter than the the usual encodings (base64, or hex) and all the DB functions should work fine.</p>

<p>So say you take md5 and store it as a large int, it will take only 16 bytes to store. But you can also only use 8 or 4 (I wouldn't dare go lower than that).</p>

"39098358","Creating same hashes like symfony2 does with java (SHA-512)","<p>I have an old Symfony2 based application here and I am developing a replacement with Dropwizard in Java.
I migrated all User records from old DB into my new Datamodel.
I also added new fields for passwords and imported the old password and salt fields, too.</p>

<p>Now I want to make the well known procedure. Let the user login, try against new password field. If it fails try the migrated ones, if they work, encode the cleartext password with the new algorithm and store the new hash in the new pasword field. So that the users are porting there password hashes from old procedure to the new one.</p>

<p>Sounds simple and normaly it's work as usual, but this Symfony and PHP drives me crazy.</p>

<p>Where I stuck is to create the same hash with java as symfony does.
The old application uses the MessageDigestPasswordEncoder with ""sha512"", base64 encoding and 5000 iterations, all defaults ;)</p>

<p>The important methods are:</p>

<p>MessageDigestPasswordEncoder:</p>

<pre><code>public function encodePassword($raw, $salt) {
  if ($this-&gt;isPasswordTooLong($raw)) {
    throw new BadCredentialsException('Invalid password.');
  }

  if (!in_array($this-&gt;algorithm, hash_algos(), true)) {
    throw new \LogicException(sprintf('The algorithm ""%s"" is not supported.', $this-&gt;algorithm));
  }

  $salted = $this-&gt;mergePasswordAndSalt($raw, $salt);
  $digest = hash($this-&gt;algorithm, $salted, true);

  // ""stretch"" hash
  for ($i = 1; $i &lt; $this-&gt;iterations; ++$i) {
    $digest = hash($this-&gt;algorithm, $digest.$salted, true);
  }

  return $this-&gt;encodeHashAsBase64 ? base64_encode($digest) : bin2hex($digest);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And BasePasswordEncoder:</p>

<pre><code>protected function mergePasswordAndSalt($password, $salt) {
  if (empty($salt)) {
    return $password;
  }

  if (false !== strrpos($salt, '{') || false !== strrpos($salt, '}')) {
    throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Cannot use { or } in salt.');
  }

  return $password.'{'.$salt.'}';
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's seems straight forward but I stuck with it.
As I read this it does:</p>

<ol>
<li>Merge salt and clear text password to: ""password{salt}""</li>
<li>Hash this string with SHA-512 and return a binary string into digest variable</li>
<li>iterate 5k times and use digest concatenated with merged cleartext password to rehash into digest</li>
<li>encode digest to base64</li>
</ol>

<p>So here are my try in Java:</p>

<pre><code>import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.Base64;

public void legacyEncryption(String salt, String clearPassword) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
  // Get digester instance for algorithm ""SHA-512"" using BounceCastle
  MessageDigest digester = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-512"", new BouncyCastleProvider());

  // Create salted password string
  String mergedPasswordAndSalt = clearPassword + ""{"" + salt + ""}"";

  // First time hash the input string by using UTF-8 encoded bytes.
  byte[] hash = digester.digest(mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

  // Loop 5k times
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5000; i++) {
    // Concatenate the hash bytes with the clearPassword bytes and rehash
    hash = digester.digest(ArrayUtils.addAll(hash, mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));
  }

  // Log the resulting hash as base64 String
  logger.info(""Legace password digest: salt="" + salt + "" hash="" + Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hash));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does anybody see the problem? I think the difference is in the result of the:
PHP: binary.binary
and the
JAVA: addAll(byte[],byte[])</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","<p>The implementation on php side is correctly doing 5k iterations by doing first round of hashing and then looping 4999 times.</p>

<pre><code>$digest = hash($this-&gt;algorithm, $salted, true);

for ($i = 1; $i &lt; $this-&gt;iterations; ++$i) {
  $digest = hash($this-&gt;algorithm, $digest.$salted, true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the the java implementation the for loop starts at 0 which results in 5k + 1 iteration.</p>

<p>By starting the for loop at 1 in java too, the resulting password hashes are then equals.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] hash = digester.digest(mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8""));

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5000; i++) {
  hash = digester.digest(ArrayUtils.addAll(hash, mergedPasswordAndSalt.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));

<p>A string that contains 40 character in 0-9 or a-f in a row.</p>

<p>In other words, the first pattern would consider this invalid whereas the second would not:</p>

","<p>First, you are not talking about a <em>collision</em>. A collision is when someone finds two <em>distinct</em> messages which hash to the same value. Here you are not fearing someone finding <em>another</em> input which hash to the value you publish; indeed, you fear someone finding <em>your</em> input. The correct term is <strong>preimage attack</strong>. Sometimes, we say that the attacker is trying to ""invert"" the hash function (find an input matching a given output).</p>

<p>There are two ways to try to find a preimage for a given hash value: exploit a weakness of the hash function, or guess the input by trying out candidates.</p>

<p>There is no known weakness of SHA-2 with regards to preimage resistance. Come to that, there is no such known weakness for MD5 or even MD4, although those two functions are considered to be, cryptographically speaking, thoroughly broken. Therefore, barring stupendous advances in scientific research on hash function, chances are that your hash value will not be found through a hash function cryptographic weakness.</p>

<p>Trying candidates may be possible, or not, depending on what the attacker knows of the input. This is quite hard to accurately model. Suppose, for instance, that the input is a single word containing seven letters. There are 26<sup>7</sup> = 8031810176 such words. Trying out all of them with SHA-256, comparing each time with your hash value, takes a few minutes on a recent PC, with a naive implementation.</p>

<p>On a more general basis, exploring the set of possible inputs is called a <strong>dictionary attack</strong> because it is often applied on the problem of recovering a user password: users are depressingly unimaginative and often choose passwords from a limited set of, well, ""words"", and it seems logical to call ""dictionary"" that set of words. We also call it ""brute force"" or ""exhaustive search"".</p>

<p>Assuming that the dictionary is sufficiently small for an attacker to realistically try out all its words, then not only your hash value will be eventually inverted (if there is enough incentive for the attacker), but this also opens the way for <strong>cost sharing</strong>: the attacker may try to share his computing efforts across several similar attack situations (i.e. several hash values to invert, with the same hash function -- there again, a common password-related attack model). A basic cost sharing method is to make a <strong>precomputed table</strong>: the attacker computes all the hashes for his dictionary <em>once</em>; then, all subsequent hash values can be attacked by simply looking up the hash value in the table. A lookup is very fast (the attacker sorts his hashes in increasing order). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table"" rel=""nofollow"">Rainbow tables</a> are a kind of precomputed table, in a smart way which allows for a compact representation: they make it possible for the attacker to ""keep"" a big precomputed table without needing a truckload of hard disks. Still, rainbow or not, all the values in the table (the one <em>before</em> compression in the case of a rainbow table) must be computed at least once by an attacker somewhere, i.e. that someone is able to do a full dictionary attack. This has two costs: the CPU cost (for computing all the hashes) and the storage cost (for storing the hash values). A rainbow table makes the storage cheaper, but does not improve things with regards to CPU.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Salting</a> defeats precomputed tables (including rainbow tables). It makes small dictionaries more tolerable. That is, if we assume that inverting <em>one</em> hash value is doable, then the salt makes sure that, <em>at least</em>, the attacker will have to pay the full CPU cost of a dictionary attack each time, and he won't be able to share his cost across several attacks or with other attackers. Salting is needed for passwords, because it turned out to be impossible, in all generality, to make generic users choose and remember passwords from a large enough set of possible passwords.</p>

<p>It still is much better if your input is from a dictionary large enough to defeat a single brute forcing effort. The important thing is the size of the set of values which your input string may take; that set must be estimated with regards to what the attacker knows of the attacked data. For instance, if the attacker is trying to find a user password, then he knows that the input string is short (users have little patience) and consists only in characters that can be input (blindly !) on a keyboard; and he also knows that the sequence can be memorized, which makes things like "".%f*(.ds/~\d09j@"" quite improbable. There is no limit per se on the input size; we say that rainbow tables are limited to ""15 characters or so"" because users who accept to type more than 15 characters will also choose passwords from too large a set to allow the single brute force effort needed for table construction. Note that trying <em>all</em> sequences of 15 characters is already way too much (even all sequences of 15 lowercase letters imply more than 2<sup>70</sup> hash computations, and that's not really feasible with today's technology).</p>

<p>Drop a penny on the street. How long does it take until someone picks it up?<br>
Now drop a $20 bill and do the same experiment.</p>

<p>If the value of what you are trying to secure is <strong>low</strong>, it is possible that nobody will try to break the hash at all.</p>

<p>If the value and benefit of breaking the hash is <strong>high</strong>, it will only survive as long as it takes to buy the necessary computing power from the Amazon cloud. They now even sell GPUs.</p>

","<p>On the Python piece you are using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for signing. On the Java piece you are using PSS. As you are using different schemes it's only natural that these two won't produce the same output. Generally it is more recommended to use PSS scheme over v1.5.</p>

","<p>I created this answer based on the tag <code>inline assembly</code> with no specific language mentioned. <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Extended assembly templates</a> already assume use of extensions to the languages.</p>

<p>If the <code>Yz</code> constraint isn't available you can attempt to create a temporary variable to tell <em>CLANG</em> what register to use rather than a constraint. You can do this through what is called an <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160821083608/https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Local-Register-Variables.html#Local-Register-Variables"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Explicit Register Variable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can define a local register variable and associate it with a specified register like this:</p>

<pre><code> register int *foo asm (""r12"");
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Here r12 is the name of the register that should be used. Note that this is the same syntax used for defining global register variables, but for a local variable the declaration appears within a function. The register keyword is required, and cannot be combined with static. The register name must be a valid register name for the target platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case you wish to force usage of <code>xmm0</code> register. You could assign the <code>c</code> parameter to a temporary variable using an explicit register and use that temporary as a parameter to the Extended Inline Assembly. This is the primary purpose of explicit registers in <em>GCC/CLANG</em>.</p>

<pre><code>GCC_INLINE __m128i GCC_INLINE_ATTRIB
MM_SHA256RNDS2_EPU32(__m128i a, const __m128i b, const __m128i c)
{
   register const __m128i tmpc asm(""xmm0"") = c;
   __asm__(""sha256rnds2 %2, %1, %0"" : ""+x""(a) : ""x""(b), ""x"" (tmpc));
    return a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler should be able to provide some optimizations now since it has more knowledge as to how the <code>xmm0</code> register is to be used.</p>

<p>When you placed <code>mov %2, %%xmm0;</code> into the template <em>CLANG</em> (and <em>GCC</em>) do not do any optimizations on the instructions. Basic Assembly and Extended Assembly templates are a black box that it only knows how to do basic substitution based on the constraints.</p>

","<p>That looks about right, except that the salt should be fixed length (e.g. always 32 bytes); you're correct that it should be random and per-user.  I don't see any real benefit to encrypting the salt.  Salts defend against a scenario when the attacker already has a cleartext version of your database.</p>

<p>As far as multi-language, you should just be consistent about what character encoding you use in your application, and what <em>exactly</em> you're calling SHA-256 on.</p>

","<p><strong>On salts:</strong></p>

<p>The salt is public data (if it was meant to be confidential then it would not be called a ""salt"" but a ""key""). The salt must be known to verify a password (since it enters the hash function along with the password) so it is stored as cleartext, as you intend to do.</p>

<p>The point of the salt is to prevent an attacker from sharing attack costs between attack instances. Guessing a user-chosen password is often possible (users only have human brains and are rarely good at memorizing complex passwords). The salt makes sure that, at least, an attacker will have to pay the full price of password guessing (i.e. ""trying"" a big dictionary of possible passwords) for <em>each</em> attacked password.</p>

<p>The salt works well as long as it is unique for each password. Note that unique for each <em>user</em> is not sufficient: sometimes, users change their passwords, and you do not want the same salt to be used for the next password (otherwise, some level of cost sharing becomes available to the attacker). So you want the select a new salt any time a password is stored, i.e. when the account is created <em>and</em> whenever the password is changed.</p>

<p>Uniqueness of salts is easily ensured by using big enough random salts. 32-byte salts are more than enough for that: the risk of selecting twice the same salt (out of bad luck) is negligible.</p>

<p>An additional level of security, beyond salting, is to make password hashing ""expensive"". For instance, when you hash the (salted) password, you actually hash the concatenation of 10000 times the salt+password sequence. This makes password verification 10000 times more expensive, both for you and for the attacker. It is often the case that legitimate password verification can be made computationally heavier with no noticeable effect (even if you check 100 user passwords per second, you can still devote 100µs to that, and it will use only 1% of your processing time), but making things 10000 times harder for the attacker is a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>On languages:</strong></p>

<p>The main problem with non-ASCII passwords is that some glyphs may use several encodings. For instance, an 'é' can be encoded, with Unicode, as a single code point (U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE) or as two code points (U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E, followed by U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT). Note that this example is about a fairly common French letter, nothing as fancy (computer-wise) as Chinese or Korean. Encoding issues can be handled through <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/"" rel=""nofollow"">Unicode Normalization Forms</a> but this is not an easy programming tasks. Some programming environments can help (e.g., in Java, use <code>java.text.Normalizer</code>, which implements UNF).</p>

<p>Also, non-ASCII passwords can prove difficult to enter for users who switch keyboards, e.g. when the user wants to use a shared computer in an hotel or an airport (typing sensitive passwords on such systems is not a really good idea anyway).</p>

<p>I would recommend trying to enforce ASCII-only passwords if possible, or otherwise bite the bullet: perform UNF (with NFD form), then UTF-8 encoding. The resulting sequence of bytes is what goes to the hashing stage.</p>

What information is added to the hash in <code>CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS</code> mechanism that turns in a complete different signature?</p>
","<p>Mechanims <code>CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS</code> does following things:</p>

<p>Answer by <code>Ilmari Karonen</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Honestly, in practice, there are very few if any reasons to use
  SHA-224.</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/15151/sha-224-purpose/15155#15155"">As fgrieu notes</a>, SHA-224 is simply SHA-256 with a different IV and
  with 32 of the output bits thrown away. For most purposes, if you want
  a hash with more than 128 but less than 256 bits, simply using SHA-256
  and truncating the output yourself to the desired bit length is
  simpler and just as efficient as using SHA-224. As you observe,
  SHA-256 is also more likely to be available on different platforms
  than SHA-224, making it the better choice for portability.</p>
  
  <p>Why would you ever want to use SHA-224, then?</p>
  
  <p>The obvious use case is if you need to implement an existing protocol
  that specifies the use of SHA-224 hashes. While, for the reasons
  described above, it's not a very common choice, I'm sure such
  protocols do exist.</p>
  
  <p>Also, a minor advantage of SHA-224 over truncated SHA-256 is that, due
  to the different IV, knowing the SHA-224 hash of a given message does
  not reveal anything useful about its SHA-256 hash, or vice versa. This
  is really more of an ""idiot-proofing"" feature; since the two hashes
  have different names, careless users might assume that their outputs
  have nothing in common, so NIST changed the IV to ensure that this is
  indeed the case.</p>
  
  <p>However, this isn't really something you should generally rely on. If
  you really need to compute multiple unrelated hashes of the same input
  string, what you probably want instead is a keyed PRF like HMAC, which
  can be instantiated using any common hash function (such as SHA-256).</p>

<p>Part of the Thomas Pornin's answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ECDSA over a 256-bit curve already achieves an ""unbreakable"" level of
  security (i.e. roughly the same level than AES with a 128-bit key, or
  SHA-256 against collisions). Note that there are elliptic curves on
  prime fields, and curves on binary fields; which kind is most
  efficient depends on the involved hardware (for curves of similar
  size, a PC will prefer the curves on a prime field, but dedicated
  hardware will be easier to build with binary fields; the CLMUL
  instructions on the newer Intel and AMD processors may change that).</p>
  
  <p>SHA-512 uses 64-bit operations. This is fast on a PC, not so fast on a
  smartcard. SHA-256 is often a better deal on small hardware (including
  32-bit architectures such as home routers or smartphones)</p>

<p>I want (for no other reason than to have fun) to find an algorithm to map that SHA1 hash to a computer-generated (pseudo-)English phrase. The mapping should be bidirectional (i.e., knowing the algorithm, one must be able to calculate the original SHA1 hash from that phrase.)</p>

<p>A variation: it is OK if I will be able to work only with a part of hash. Say, first six hex digits is fine.</p>

","<p>Hash function means it is not possible (within reasonable limits) to get a data from hash, unless it is broken (insecure).</p>

<p>Question should be about breaking <strong>SHA-1</strong> hash algorithm - look at Google, it's <strong>not that broken</strong>. So no, you cannot create English phrase from SHA-1 hash code, if you can, please make a huge paper about that, lot of them are useless, this would be breakthrough :-)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> if only part of hash is enough, I suggest just brute force (+ simple map of hash&lt;->phrase, possibly in a file or db), breaking hash algorithm is very ""strong soup"" (difficult problem).</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> guys be more specific when asking question, not my fault... I will not delete this so that it scares off any other crypto guys around :-)</p>

","<p>We'll, lets see... The english language <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/06/a-million-english-words-give-or-take-half-a-million/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has about 1,000,000 words</a>. That's about 20 bits per word. SHA1 is 160 bits, so you'll need 8 words. Theoretically, All you'll have to do is to take the n'th word of the oxford english dictionary, where n is a group of 20 bits at a time.</p>

<p>Now, to make it more natural, you can try to add ""in/at/on/and/the..."" between words, according to their type (nouns,verbs...) using some simple algorithm. (You should remove all these words from your base dictionary, of course).</p>

<p>The algorithm is reversible: Just remove all the words you've added, and convert each word to it's 20-bit index.</p>

<p>Also, try google ""insult generator"". Some of those generators are pretty nice. I'm not sure about the number of combinations, though.</p>

<p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0199563837"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">You can buy</a> the Oxford English Dictionary on CD-ROM with more than 500,000 words (19-bit).

","<p>A very simple approach would be:
 Take list of say 1024 nouns, 1024 verbs and 1024 adjectives each. Your phrase could then be  sentence of the form</p>

<pre><code>noun[bits_01-10] verb[bits11-20] adjective[bits21-30] verb[bits31-40],
noun[bits_41-50] verb[bits51-60] adjective[bits61-70] verb[bits71-80],
noun[bits_81-90] verb[bits91-100] adjective[bits101-110] verb[bits111-120] and 
noun[bits_121-130] verb[bits131-140] adjective[bits141-150] verb[bits151-160].
</code></pre>

<p>With a bit more linguistic thought you can probably construct slightly more complicated ad thus not so repetitive looking sentences (say, a bit for singular / plural, a bit of two for different tenses,...). Longer word lists use up a few more bits but my guess is that you reach rather exotic words quite fast.  </p>

","<p>Your sample values are in hex, whereas the XML contains base64.</p>

<p>For example, your SHA-256 value is 64 hex digits, so 32 bytes - which makes sense for SHA-256, which is 256 bits.</p>

<p>The <code>DigestValue</code> in the XML is 44 characters including one padding character - which is what I'd expect for 32 bytes, where every 3 bytes require 4 characters.</p>

<p>For example, here's some C# code to take the base64 hash and convert it to (dash-separated) hex:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Text;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        byte[] hash = Convert.FromBase64String(""wgvWtVSJns8mCgUPfBZ/2ZTBfKqR02zW0MD4tA3cIBE="");
        Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(hash));

</code></pre>

<p>... which matches the hash you computed for the original file, so at least you know you're computing it the right way.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about Tizen itself, but it sounds like you may need to update that XML file to include the base64 of the SHA-256 hash... or if you delete it, does the tooling replace it for you?</p>

<p>I'm looking for ways to improve this. Is there a library I can use which will perform better in this case? The private key always remains the same, so maybe something which doesn't have to create new signing objects / buffers each time it is used? Unfortunately, as the profiler only gives an <code>UNKNOWN</code> for the code inside the <code>crypto</code> library, I'm not sure where the exact bottleneck is occurring. Is there a way to get the profiller to also show the stack trace when calling NodeJS libraries?</p>

<p>If it helps, I'm using Visual Studio 2015. I've tried using the built-in 64-bit cl.exe compiler, and while it does give me a different hash, it's still not the target one. What am I doing wrong here? </p>
","<p>There are two bugs in this implementation:</p>

<ol>
<li>In <code>rotr</code>, you should have <code>64 - n</code> instead of <code>32 - n</code></li>
<li>You should remove all <code>% (long long)(pow(2, 64));</code>. If you used <code>uint64_t</code> instead of <code>unsigned long long</code>, these weren't needed. And they cause bug here, because <code>long long</code> is usually 64-bit, and it cannot store the number 2^64. Using <code>uint64_t</code> ""automatically"" uses modulo 2^64.</li>
</ol>

<p>And it is questionable to put all these function definitions and data into the header file. You should use <code>inline</code> for function definitions, at least. But you'd better move them into the <code>.cpp</code>.</p>

Simply using a good hash is insufficient because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it does not protect you from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rainbow table attacks</a>.  The same password will hash to the same result, every time.  An attacker can compromise on the time vs. space tradeoff, pre-compute the most popular passwords and simply look up the answer.  To defeat, you need to add a salt.  (Mike suggests user id)  </p></li>
<li><p>as you suggest, hashing algorithms are designed to be fast.  This is sometimes desired, (such as getting the hash of a 50MB file) but in the case of passwords it not.  Use a password-based key derivation function instead.  It will significantly slow down an attacker, but not impact your own speed.</p></li>

"19759645","How to reliably re-calculate blob sha1 hash (or another identity) from (user) text content and escape line-end/whitespace hell?","<p>I have some code for Node.js that pull text files from Git (local Git or via the Github API) and uses the commit/tree/blob data in various scenarios. But I have problems with the line endings and recalculating sha hashes after I (or the user) uses the files. </p>

<p>The data consist of source-code. It gets downloaded/used/linked/imported to a users project directory and used in development. I was hoping to use the git blob hashes to check for changes relative to the source blob.</p>

<p>My setup:</p>

<p>I'm on Windows but use Travis-CI and a VM to run builds.</p>

<p>I use this function to calculate the sha1-hash as hex-string:</p>

<pre><code>var crypto = require('crypto');
function blobShaHex(data:NodeBuffer, encoding?:string):string {
    return crypto.createHash('sha1').update('blob ' + data.length + '\0').update(data, encoding).digest('hex');
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far this seems to work very well: data read as raw Buffers straight from the repos match their hashe, same with utf8 content.</p>

<p>Problem:</p>

<p>In practical user-use of the blob content the line endings break the blob sha1:</p>

<p>The file might get checked-in into a VCS and then get mangled by line-end conversions. Also the user's IDE may normalise line-breaks to user preference, even if the user never saves the file. Many other things may happen.</p>

<p>Note: my code is <em>not</em> pulling the blob <em>from</em> the Git repo where the files end up. Instead it is a separate thing (like dependency manager) that just moves blob-originating files around, which may-or-may not get checked in somewhere.</p>

<p>To make things extra messy I have no full control over the source-repo's line-endings so there is no guarantee about which style then come down with. Might even be mixed conventions (if that technically possible?).</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>Is there some way to revert to the original linebreaks or otherwise verify a match? I could pull the original file again and do stuff with it.</p>

<p>Any advice on handling this would be welcome.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Now I typed this all up I'm starting to think it might be a really non-practical idea to attempt this. Maybe it'd be better to force normalise and create&amp;track my own checksums or use some clever white-space ignoring diff thing? </p>
","<p>I'll go with a custom hasher that normalises linebreaks and such instead of using Git's blobs sha hashes.</p>

<p>I check the md5 method for username &amp; Password but how can I hide it on the file :(</p>

<p>please help me because it's very important to me!
Thanks a lot ...</p>
","<p>Hard-coding the password in the PHP file is not <em>per se</em> a huge security issue, as someone would need to access the PHP file anyway to read it: if someone gained access to your PHP files you would have a much bigger problem than your lost password.</p>

<p>However, avoid:</p>

<ol>
<li>storing the password in clear text, save an hash instead.</li>
<li>storing the password in JS files, as the source of JS files is accessible by the client</li>
</ol>

<p>There are different types of hashes, I would suggest not to use MD5, especially if your password is not very complex. Sites like <a href=""http://www.md5decrypter.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> hold databases of MD5 hashes, so your hash could easily be cracked.
Use something a bit more secure, like SHA256.</p>

<p>NOTE: obviously whoever owns the server has the physical access to your files and DB, but if you stored the hash you should be fine. If you are really concerned about the possibility that whoever owns the server has a look through your ""secure"" stuff, you shouldn't be using a shared server as a start.</p>

","<p>There's no known easy or even moderately difficult way to do this in general.</p>

<p>The entire point of hashes (or so-called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function"" rel=""nofollow"">one-way functions</a>), is that it's easy to compute them, but next to impossible to reverse their computation (find input values based on output). That said, for some hash functions, there are known methods that may allow computing inputs for a given hash value in reasonable time.</p>

<p>For example, this <a href=""http://cryptography.hyperlink.cz/md5/MD5_collisions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">MD5 sum technique</a> will find collisions (but not input for a given output) in about 8 hours on a 1.6GHz computer.</p>

","<p>This would be a ""preimage attack"". No such thing is publicly known against SHA-1.</p>

<p>The only attack known against SHA-1 is a collision attack. That means I find two inputs that produce the same result, but neither of them is pre-ordained, so to speak. Even so, this attack isn't really feasible for most people -- based on the amount of computation involved, the closest I can figure is that you'd have to spend somewhere in the range of a few million dollars to build a machine that would give you about one colliding pair of keys per week (assuming it ran, doing nothing else 24/7).</p>

algorithm explicitly using the -a option, e.g.

  shasum -a 512224 -c checksumfile

","<p>This answer is not so much for the OP (who is hopefully sorted now) but any passers by who encounter the error in the question.</p>

<p>The error </p>

<pre><code>shasum: [CHECKSUM_FILENAME] : no properly formatted SHA[TYPE] checksum lines found

<p>indicates that the checksum file passed to the -c flag is <strong>not formatted</strong> as 
follows</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Where </p>

<ul>
<li>the first field is <strong>the expected checksum</strong>,</li>
<li>the second field is a ' ' character indicating that the file is to be checked as a text file (as opposed to being checked as a binary file or being checking in Universal mode which  ignores newlines) </li>
<li>and the third field is <strong>the name of the file you likely just downloaded</strong> and whose integrity you want to verify</li>
</ul>

<p>So in the example above the developers who created kbld <a href=""https://github.com/k14s/kbld/releases/tag/v0.7.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supplied the above text on their release page</a> to show the checksums that they calculated after they built the kbld binaries for various platforms.</p>

<p>I added the line for the linux build to a file called <code>kbld_v0_7_0.checksum</code> and then I ran the following in the directory where I downloaded the kbld-linux-amd64 binary </p>

<pre><code>$ shasum -c kbld_v0_7_0.checksum -a 256
./kbld-linux-amd64: OK
</code></pre>

<p>The OK from shasum shows that the binary that I downloaded, ./kbld-linux-amd64 , generates the same sha256 checksum that was produced when the developers did their build which indicates that the files are, in all likelihood, identical</p>

","<p>My understanding is, that repeated hashing (for computational cost) &amp; a good random salt, should defeat all but seriously determined cryptographic attackers.</p>

<p>Hashing passwords in the database, and over the network, avoids plaintext being recoverable (and usable elsewhere) by a snooper or attacker who does get in.</p>

<p>Basically this is more or less the scheme, used by the Wordpress authentication:</p>

<pre><code>var SALT = 64 random characters;
var NUM_HASHES = about 1000;    // can be randomized
var hashedResult = inputPassword;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_HASHES; i++) {
  var dataToHash = SALT + hashedResult;
  hashedResult = secureHash( dataToHash);
}
//... can now store or send.
</code></pre>

<p>This use of a random salt, and looping hash, defeats any rainbow tables or single-level 'hash collision', 'hash weakness' attack. Only brute-forcing the complete keyspace, each key through 1000 iterations of the hash function, is believed to defeat it :)</p>

<li>Generate random salt for each password.</li>
<li>Avoid MD5, and even SHA-1.</li>
<li>Use a slow hashing algorithm; SHA-256 seems to be a good choice for now.</li>
<li>Password storage is one of those rare occasions where there is some benefit to having your own (overall) algorithm.  Consider an attacker with a rainbow table; if your password storage algorithm varies from the one used to generate their rainbow table enough to change the generated values, that rainbow table is of no use.  The attacker would need to know your algorithm, then generate a new table.  If you choose a slow hashing algorithm, generating a new table is very expensive.</li>
</ol>

<p>By ""overall"" algorithm, I mean the complete definition of how you transform the plaintext password into the stored value.  E.g. <code>SHA-256(""mypassword"" + ""[["" + 40-char-random-alphanum-salt + ""]]"")</code>.  If you change that to use angle brackets instead of square brackets, you've changed the rainbow table necessary to exploit your stored passwords.  Note that I'm not advocating writing your own hash algorithm; you should still choose a cryptographically secure hash algorithm.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/md5-password-scrambler-no-longer-safe/12317"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> by the author of MD5.  He makes the two main points I repeated above: 1) if you use a fast hashing algorithm, you're missing the point, and 2) reuse of overall algorithms allows re-use of rainbow tables.</p>

","<p>You've pretty much nailed it.  just took the hard/wrong way converting from <code>char[]</code> to <code>String</code> -> <code>new String(password)</code> is all you need.  (hint, if you find yourself manually converting between bytes and chars, you're probably doing it wrong).</p>

<p>as a side note, exceptions are ""thrown"" for a reason.  that makes it easy to skip the following code which shouldn't be executed when the exception is thrown.  by catching and turning the exceptions into ""if"" blocks, you make the code more complex than it needs to be.</p>

<p>We have a dedicated CentOS server with numerous sites, mostly WordPress. Quite a few use PayPal IPN but do not have dedicated IPs or SSL Certificates. What needs to be changed to the server so these sites will support SHA-256? Our server is situated with Limestone Networks so I've created a ticket and asked repeatedly for assistance to no avail. They keep repeating SSL's need to be updated on the server. Would that be a wildcase SSL certificate in the usage case I described? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>Based on your comments, it sounds like this is nothing to do with SHA256, but a simple CN mismatch. A certificate is only good for the names listed in it. You could try adding a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubjectAltName"" rel=""nofollow"">subjectAltName</a> for each of the required hosts, or a wildcard certificate for *.example.com (though I wouldn't trust one of those for my server.)</p>

<p>For the curious: this is for an application where I build avatars for users based on a.o. their uuid. I don't, however, want to place those uuids in the URL, but obfuscate them a little. So instead of <code>avatars/baa4833d-b962-4ab1-87c5-283c9820eac4.png</code>, we request <code>avatars/5f2a13cb1d84a2e019842cdb8d0c8b03c9e1e414.png</code>. Where <code>5f2a...</code> is e.g. <code>Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(uuid + ""secrect"")</code>. </p>

<p>On the receiving side, I am adding some basic protection that sends back a <code>400 bad request</code> whenever something is obviously false. Such as <code>avatars/haxor.png</code> or <code>avatars/traversal../../../../attempt.png</code>. Note that this is a very much simplified example.</p>

","<p>First, it is mathematically impossible to recover an original message from a message digest. A message digest is a <strong>small</strong> amount of information that is intended to act as a sort of fingerprint for a <strong>large</strong> amount of information. For example, in one of the simplest forms, a message digest might be simply the sum of the numerical values of the characters in a message. You obviously cannot recover the original message just from the sum of its characters. (Two messages that are anagrams would have the same sum, so the sum would not tell you which of the two messages was the original. And a message changed by increasing one character and decreasing another would have the same sum as the original message, so, again, the sum would not distinguish them.) This is just an example—actual cryptographic hashes are more complicated than simple sums.</p>

<p>Second, cryptographic hashes and the message digests they produce are usually <strong>designed</strong> to be difficult to invert. It is intended to be difficult to find <strong>any</strong> message whose digest equals a given value.</p>

<p>If you want cryptographic functions that change a message to a cryptic form and then invert it, you are looking for <strong>encryption</strong> and <strong>decryption</strong>, not hashes or digests.</p>

","<p>SHA-256 is called a hash algorithm, and its purpose is simple: it takes any data and generates a unique series of bytes to represent it.  There is no way to reverse this process, and there are no known instances of a SHA-256 hash being not unique.</p>

<p>The purpose of the line of code in question is to generate one character of the final SHA-256 output.  Java gives you the has in raw data (a byte array) and we typically convert it to hexadecimal to represent it as a string.  That line of code is pretty complex, so I'll go over what each part of it does separately.</p>

","<pre><code>Integer.toString((byteData[i] &amp; 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1))

<p>is one way of converting a byte value to a string that's exacly two character wide, showing the byte's hexadecimal value. Having a look at <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">String's Javadoc page</a> will help.</p>

<p>The combination of <code>0x100</code> and <code>substring(1)</code> ensures that byte values &lt; than 16 decimal (that is, 0 to F in hex) are also represented as two characters.</p>

<p>By the way:</p>

  <p>It works because Java will perform a widening conversion to int, using

<p>So I'm assuming the way Google Script is handling the new line is different to the web base generators but I can't figure out how to get them match or which one is the correct result.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>To add some further information:
Lets say <code>SystemTimeMilli = 1234567890123</code> </p>

<p>When I enter <code>('Some Text' + SystemTimeMilli)</code> into my script using
<code>bEDtDJnW0y/Ll4YZitxb+D5sTNnEpQKH67EJRCmQCqN9cvGiB8+IHzB7HjsOs3mSlxLmu4aiPDRpe9anuWzylw==</code> as the <code>PrivateKey</code></p>

<p>I get
<code>oDVJk38b634G9Ykdqm+hVmSb5C8h6/re5/XG+MjyddTKygWcoZjWu0DfNGY/JWu5Be41zLDKfEZnuFcACrvs7w==</code> returned.</p>

<p>Which is the same if I enter <code>/account/balance1234567890123</code> into <a href=""https://quickhash.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://quickhash.com</a> using SHA-512 (SHA2) as the Algorithm and Base64 Encoding as the Output Format.</p>

<p>However if I enter <code>('Some Text' + '\n' + SystemTimeMilli)</code> in my script it returns <code>3sj1jbx1tQ4nc8XOkk3nW8TvG5zvCam2LN51fQWDXOKU5O/1KBAdzdp+YV+aAdYHWCY2x3jqCfbXKoOmfoD0KA==</code></p>

<p>But using </p>

<p><code>/account/balance
1234567890123</code></p>

<p>in quickhash.com returns something different. I've tried a whole bunch of different combinations but I never get the same result as my script. </p>

<p>I having trouble with getting my script to authenticate to the API so I really want to determine if I'm getting the correct HMAC to begin with.</p>

"45033876","what is difference between sha1 certificate and sha2 certificate?","<p>I know the difference between sha1 and sha 2 algorithm but when we create a certificate specifying the sha1 vs sha2 makes what difference to the ssl certificate?</p>

<p>Let me know if you need more information.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Naga</p>
","<p>The difference between those certificates is the strength of the hash function used for the digital signature created by the issuer of the certificate. SHA-1 is considered too weak since hash collision attacks are possible. Such a collision would allow the creation of a new certificate by the attacker which uses an existing signature and is thus considered trusted. The SHA-2 family of hash functions is considered strong enough and thus used today, mostly  with SHA-256. </p>

I'd like to append the sha to the end of the commit message so my git gui can build a link to GitHub for me.</p>
","<p>The SHA1 has not yet been generated (the commit has not yet happened, because the hook can prevent it) and depends on the contents of the message.  So if your hook were to compute ""what it would be"" and then modify the message, the result would be different from the computed SHA1.</p>

<p>Thus, while it would be possible to compute ""what the SHA1 will be"", you can't then dump it into the commit message.</p>

<p>Here's how to compute the SHA1 of an actual commit, though, given the SHA1 of the commit :-) or a name that refers to it:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p HEAD &gt; /tmp/t
$ git hash-object -t commit /tmp/t
ea5670c9d18fb1482ea2f3022c96e287afb3e906
$ git rev-parse HEAD
ea5670c9d18fb1482ea2f3022c96e287afb3e906
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, if you know the <code>tree</code>, all the <code>parent</code>s, the <code>author</code>, and the <code>committer</code> strings and have the message text, you can figure out what the SHA1 will be.</p>

<p>I know that I am creating a message of the correct bit size (1024 bits) and also working in 1024-bit chunks, or at least I believe I am.</p>

<p>I am not sure if it has to do with the handling of the integers (the standard requires unsigned integers) or whether I made a mistake in one of the utility functions, or both. If it is indeed an issue with the handling of the integers, how would I go about taking care of the problem. I was able to resolve this when working on the 256-bit version of the adaptation by using mod 2^32 when working with numbers in the digestblock method. I attempted to do mod 2^64 and 2^63 with the 512-bit version and it does not correct the problem. I am stumped.</p>

<p>I should mention that I cannot use one of the many library implementations as I am using a sandboxed Lua that does not provide this access, which is why I need a pure lua implementation. Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, after introducing integers in Lua 5.3 writing scripts for Lua becomes a more complicated task.<br>
You must <strong>always think</strong> about transformations between integers and floating point numbers.<br>
ALWAYS.  Yes, that's boring.  </p>

<p>One of your mistakes is an excellent example of this ""dark corner of Lua"".   </p>

<pre><code>  local remainder = l % 256
  s = string.char(remainder) .. s
  --remove from l the bits we have already transformed
  l = (l-remainder) / 256
</code></pre>

<p>Your value <code>l</code> is initially a <strong>64</strong>-bit integer.<br>
After cutting off its first byte <code>l</code> contains (64-8) = <strong>56</strong> bits, but now it's a <em>floating point-number</em> (with <strong>53</strong>-bit precision, of course).</p>

<p>Possible solution: use <code>l = l &gt;&gt; 8</code> or <code>l = l // 256</code> instead of <code>l = (l-remainder) / 256</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Another mistake is using <code>s264num(msg, i + (j - 1) * 4)</code> instead of <code>s264num(msg, i + (j - 1) * 8)</code></p>

<hr>

<p>One more mistake is in the following line:</p>

<pre><code>local extra = 128 - (len + 9) % 128
</code></pre>

<p>The correct code is </p>

<pre><code>local extra = - (len + 17) % 128 + 8
</code></pre>

<p>(Please note that <code>-a%m+b</code> is not the same as <code>b-a%m</code> due to operator precedence)</p>

<hr>

<p>After fixing these 3 mistakes your code works correctly.</p>

<li>Two constants each 64 bytes long are:</li>
</ol>

<p>ipad = 0x36 (x64)</p>

<p>opad = 0x5c (x64)</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>because the key is empty string XOR results in the same opad and ipad, i.e.</li>

<p>ipad XOR key = ipad</p>

<p>opad XOR key = opad</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>At this point all left to do is to compute the HMAC itself. </li>

<p>So: HMAC = Hash(opad || Hash(ipad || message)) and that should be it. </p>

<p>But I am not sure how to execute this.

<p>What am I missing here? Does the empty message have to be padded as well? 
I suspect that I misinterpret the concatenation, but I am not sure what other options I have. Should I leave ipad and opad as hex? SHA1 methods receives string so I must convert to some sort of a string, I just can't figure out what type exactly.  </p>

","<p>The problem with my method was so obvious, it's not even funny. While appending the result of the opad and inner hash I left the inner hash in hex format but treated it as ASCII, as a result 104 bytes were sent to the outer hash instead of 84. So the solution is something like: HMAC = SHA_1(opad + HexToASCII(SHA_1(ipad)));</p>

","<p>SHA, as a hashing algorithm, is designed to prevent collisions. i.e. part of its power, and usefulness, is in limiting the strings which will hash to the same resultant value.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want to find a second string which will hash to the same hashed value as test123 hashes to. This kind of goes the intent of using SHA in the first place.</p>

<p>It is possible to brute force the values with SHA, i.e. given a hashed value, you can brute force the value that was hashed by computing hashes and comparing the hashed value to the target value. This will take some time. Other algorithms, such as bcrypt, are more difficult to brute force, but are more computationally expensive for you also.</p>

<p>and I want to do this by reversing the ""Hashed Into"" value.</p>
","<p>You're badly misunderstanding what a hash is for. It's a ONE WAY street by design. It's also designed to have a very low probability of 'collision' - two source values that hash to the same result. And by 'very low' I mean 'for practical purposes, it doesn't'. A constrained string - such as a password - simply won't do it. </p>

<p>So what typically happens for passwords - my client takes my password, generates a hash, sends it to the server. </p>

<p>The server compares that against it's list - if the hash matches, we assume that my password was correct. This means at no point is my password sent 'in the clear' nor is possible to work out what it was by grabbing the hash. </p>

<p>To avoid duplicates showing up (e.g. two people with the same password) usually you'll hash some unique values. Simplistically - username + password, when hashed.</p>

<p>The purpose of authenticating against hashes, is to ensure the cleartext password is never required to be held anywhere - and that is all. You still need to secure you communication channel (to avoid replay attacks) and you still need to protect against brute force guessing of password. </p>

<p>But brute forcing hashes is <em>by design</em> an expensive thing to attempt. You will see places where 'rainbow tables' exist, where people have taken every valid password string, and hashed it, so they can rapidly crack retrieved hashes from the server. These are big, and took a long time to generate initially though, and are defeated at least partially by salting or embedding usernames into the hash. </p>

<p>But I cannot re-iterate strongly enough - don't ever hand roll your own security unless you're REALLY sure what's going on. You'll build in weaknesses that you didn't even know existed, and your only 'security' is that no one's bothered to look yet. </p>

","<p>You should not do this.  It is insecure and vulnerable to dictionary attacks.</p>

<p>possible hashes.</p>

<p>Assuming hash values are more or less unpredictable, the odds of two files <em>accidentally</em> having the same hash are infinitesimal to the point that it's just not worth worrying about it.</p>

<p>Quoting from Scott Chacon's book <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Pro Git""</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this
  scenario is. The SHA–1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits. The number of
  randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single
  collision is about 2<sup>80</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a
  SHA–1 collision. If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming,
  and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent
  of the entire Linux kernel history (1 million Git objects) and pushing
  it into one enormous Git repository, it would take 5 years until that
  repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a
  single SHA–1 object collision. A higher probability exists that every
  member of your programming team will be attacked and killed by wolves
  in unrelated incidents on the same night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's true that there must be two 21-byte files that have the same SHA-1 hash (since there are 2<sup>168</sup> such files and only 2<sup>160</sup> possible SHA-1 hashes). <strike>No such files have ever been discovered.</strike></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE :</strong> As of February 2017, two distinct PDF files with identical SHA-1 checksums have been generated, using a technique that's more than 100,000 times as fast as a brute force attack.

","<p>In fact, what I call your ""margin of safety"" determines how many objects you can store.</p>

<p>The widely quoted ""about 2<sup>80</sup>"" number is the point at which you have approximately a 50% chance of a hash collision.  To keep the chance below about 1 out of 10<sup>18</sup>, the number of distinct objects in the repository should not exceed about 1.7 quadrillion (1.71x10<sup>15</sup>).</p>

<p>(I did some math for a book I'm working on; I haven't had it checked by a real mathematician, but when I ran the same sort of numbers against other hash sizes, my outputs agreed with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Probability_table"" rel=""nofollow"">those on Wikipedia</a>, for whatever that's worth. :-) )</p>

<p>Edit to add: here's the approximation formula.  Let <em>r</em> be the cardinality of the hash function (so <em>r</em> is 2<sup>160</sup> for SHA-1) and <em>U</em> be the desired probability-of-uniqueness (so <em>U</em> is 0.5 for the usual ""50% chance of safety, 50% chance of collision"" statistic.  The maximum number of hash inputs is:</p>

<p>(1 + sqrt(1 + 8<i>r</i> ln (1 / <em>U</em>)) / 2</p>

<p>The natural log of 1 / .5 is about 0.693, so we have about sqrt(4<i>r</i>)/2, which is of course just about sqrt(<em>r</em>).  Hence for a <em>k</em>-bit hash, ""50% probability of uniqueness"" occurs after about <em>k</em>/2 hashes.</p>

<p>To see (ballpark) how I get my number—in the neighborhood of 10<sup>15</sup> objects—let <em>U</em> = 1 - 10<sup>-18</sup>.  The natural log of this number is basically the original 10<sup>-18</sup>, which means we knock most of 2<sup>60</sup> off the range <em>r</em>, leaving about 2<sup>100</sup>.  The square root of that is about 2<sup>50</sup> which is about 10<sup>15</sup>.</p>

","<p>The mistake being made is that the SHA code is not used to generate the contents of any files, the contents are stored by Git separately. The SHA code is just used as a key to a commit. The reason commits can't just have keys just numbered from 1 and increasing is because with Git different people can work on different branches of the same project making commits without knowing about each other. When these get merged together we still need commits to have unique keys. The best way of making it so the keys will definitely be unique is using something like SHA which creates a unique code and as others have explained the probability of getting the same key is almost zero. </p>

<p>But I have searched a lot on the internet and still unable to get a proper explanation on how using these keys will secure an API that you are using on an Android app?</p>

<p>For example, Facebook needs your SHA1 key from your system along with your app's package name to be entered on their developer console and their API doesn't work on your app if the key you entered is wrong. </p>

<p>How does this mechanism work? How do they verify this on your App?</p>
","<p>Facebook is leveraging <a href=""https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Android application signing functionality</a> to provide the same type of assurance in the context of API interactions.</p>

<p>When building your application, your private key is being used to digitally sign the result. The signature validates that the build was created by the key owner and not subsequently modified.</p>

<p>Within the application, a signing certificate is stored, which is programmatically accessible.</p>

<p>In the Facebook SDK, <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/blob/791fa1fb5749e5069168698f17d78f21c1b4369c/facebook-core/src/main/java/com/facebook/FacebookSdk.java#L728"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the signing certificate is extracted</a> using the <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PackageManager class</a>.

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
","<p>Unless I'm missing it (not really familiar with the language), you don't store the salt anywhere.</p>

<p>You have to use the same salt you've used when creating the account for the verification.</p>

<p>On a side note: You can either generate a random salt for every user account or use a fixed salt for all accounts. Either method works. The first is theoretically more secure, but if the salt is long enough, both are fine for practical purposes.</p>

"9616120","Securing rest service","<p>I’m designing a REST service that needs to be well secured against unauthorized access. I’m thinking about requiring a security digest that’s generated by hashing all request parameters plus a secret key with sha-256 and making the service only available over https. Can anyone tell me if this is sufficient security? </p>
","<p>First of all, make sure you are using en <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC"" rel=""nofollow"">HMAC</a>, not a plain SHA-256 to generate the ""security digest"".</p>

<p>Next, what are you going to put into the input of this digest? You'll want to have at least the method, the URI, the payload, and very possibly most of the headers of the request (there are many headers that affect the meaning of an HTTP request that are important in a REST context). That might be difficult depending on what HTTP client you are using because the client might set or change headers in a way that you do not directly control.</p>

<p>Finally, where are you going to put this digest? A custom header (e.g. <code>X-Request-Authenticator</code>) seems sensible, or maybe a cookie if the client is running in a web browser.</p>

<p>I would recommend using existing tools if you can, instead of creating something yourself. Using SSL already gives you message integrity protection so start with that. Then, if you just need simple access control, HTTP basic auth will work just fine with a REST request. Or you could have the client present a certificate and verify it.</p>

These get encoded as <code>&amp;amp;</code>, <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code> and <code>&amp;quot;</code>, respectively.

<p>Has anyone here come up with something?</p>
","<p>This question is about vulnerability to Greasemonkey intercepting passwords, right?</p>

<p>In that case, SSL does <strong>nothing</strong> to protect against theft of the user's credentials, the password (or hash, or whatever) will be obtained right from the user's browser and transmitted to the bad guys via <a href=""http://wiki.greasespot.net/GM_xmlhttpRequest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GM_xmlhttpRequest()</a>.</p>

<p>If you try to encode or hash the password, client-side, Greasemonkey can intercept or even replace the responsible JS.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/8548141/331508"">""Can a website know if I am running a userscript?""</a>, you can make it harder for a script writer but, ultimately, if the bad-guys can get the user to install a Greasemonkey script (or worse, a full-on add-on/extension) then you can only make it harder -- not impossible -- for the user's account to be compromised.</p>

<p>I wouldn't even worry about it until/unless you have evidence that a malicious script or add-on is in use.  Ultimately, <strong>the user is responsible for keeping his browser</strong>, and client-side interactions, <strong>secure</strong>.</p>

<p>Things you can do to make it harder (not impossible) for a scripter:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monitor your logs, checking for unusual activity (should be doing this anyway).</li>
<li>Take protections against bots in general, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/111576/331508"">""When the bots attack!""</a>, for example.</li>
<li>Warn user(s) if an <em>actual</em> script or ploy is detected.  </li>
<li>Monitor the users' accounts/actions for unusual activity.</li>
<li>You can intercept the password, as it is typed, with JS and one-time encode some how.  This will filter out the causal scripters but not the determined ones. Note that I do not recommend this, just including it for completeness.</li>
<li>Put the password entry in a Flash dialog.  Pure Greasemonkey has a hard time interacting with Flash.  Again, I don't think this is cost-effective, but include it for completeness. </li>
<li>Do NOT require any more tedious steps for legit users (one-time passwords, third channel authentication, etc.).  This will only annoy the ever-loving heck out of your victims until they find a better alternative or workarounds (which they will).</li>

I'd recommend <a href=""http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/"" rel=""nofollow"">this base64 implementation</a> which is public domain and has a sensible API - the encoding calls return a String, which is entirely appropriate.

","<p>To access APIs in Android from Google API console you need to generate an API Key. This same API key can be used for accessing multiple APIs under the same project. To generate an API key you require, SHA1 fingerprint of your keystore. Keystore is basically a place where the private keys for your app are kept. In simple words its a certificate generated by a user or a program, used for signing an Android app.</p>

<p>In Android, there are two types of keystores. A debug keystore and a release keystore. Debug keystore is generated automatically when the Android SDK is installed or run for the first time. Release keystore has to be generated manually by the user for each application before release. As it requires private information such as name, password etc. To obtain an Android SHA1 fingerprint from your desired keystore.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('480p.m4v')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print str(f)
&lt;open file '480p.m4v', mode 'r' at 0x0224C9D0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll note that the address of the object is obviously changing between the different instances, causing the hash to change. Apparently the memory location of one file object is reused by every second other instance created, causing the hashes to coincide.</p>

<p>To hash the contents of the file, you can use this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sha = str(hashlib.sha224(f.read()).hexdigest())    # read() slurps the whole file into a string

","<p>As the others said, the reason this is failing is that you're hashing the object's string representation. I expect the reason it's alternating is because the string representation includes the memory address the file object is stored at. When you do:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(...)
</code></pre>

<p>you store that file object in <code>f</code>, pointing to memory X. When you do the same thing again, <code>open()</code> is called and allocates more memory. Since <code>f</code> is still pointing to memory X, that memory remains in use, and the second <code>open()</code> allocates new memory at Y instead. However, as soon as <code>open()</code> returns the result is assigned to <code>f</code>. Now the file object pointing to memory X is dangling and is garbage-collected. The next call to <code>open()</code> will reuse the memory at X since it's free now (this isn't guaranteed, but is common)</p>

"43682324","Swift: Signing with SHA256 not working like in amazon aws example","<p>Hello I want to create a signature for amazon-aws with swift but the given example is resulting other hashes than my functions. </p>

<p>The example is given here:
<a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html</a></p>

<p>and looks like this with JS:</p>

<pre><code>var crypto = require(""crypto-js"");

function getSignatureKey(Crypto, key, dateStamp, regionName, serviceName) {
    var kDate = Crypto.HmacSHA256(dateStamp, ""AWS4"" + key);
    var kRegion = Crypto.HmacSHA256(regionName, kDate);
    var kService = Crypto.HmacSHA256(serviceName, kRegion);
    var kSigning = Crypto.HmacSHA256(""aws4_request"", kService);
    return kSigning;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The input is this:</p>

<pre><code>key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
dateStamp = '20120215'
regionName = 'us-east-1'
serviceName = 'iam'
</code></pre>

<p>And it should result the following:</p>

<pre><code>kSecret  = '41575334774a616c725855746e46454d492f4b374d44454e472b62507852666943594558414d504c454b4559'
kDate    = '969fbb94feb542b71ede6f87fe4d5fa29c789342b0f407474670f0c2489e0a0d'
kRegion  = '69daa0209cd9c5ff5c8ced464a696fd4252e981430b10e3d3fd8e2f197d7a70c'
kService = 'f72cfd46f26bc4643f06a11eabb6c0ba18780c19a8da0c31ace671265e3c87fa'
kSigning = 'f4780e2d9f65fa895f9c67b32ce1baf0b0d8a43505a000a1a9e090d414db404d'
</code></pre>

<p>So my swift solution looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    let kSecret = ""AWS4wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"".data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kDate = ""20120215"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kSecret!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kRegion = ""us-east-1"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kDate!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kService = ""iam"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kRegion!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
    let kSigning = ""aws4_request"".hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA256, key: kService!).data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)?.hexEncodedString()
</code></pre>

<p>But what I get as result is following:</p>

<pre><code>kSecret: ""41575334774a616c725855746e46454d492f4b374d44454e472b62507852666943594558414d504c454b4559""
kDate: ""536c634e5047706e3276437146796a41722f677a6657637a68742b48364f755469772b72436363686868453d""
kRegion: ""416e524c31512b47434a624d4a2f4d4945755133574176622b65676c54475159576568674c6179414549383d""
kService: ""32624f4c5a514a517a796779626b485230775564583675687844796e66366147512f2f4d41304464506b4d3d""
kSigning: ""4652316463434b5472665476524254544245384d646653674a413377663053534e4554317a7a6f2b4f4b6f3d""
</code></pre>

<p>So the first hash matches but after that none of them match. I even think maybe the SHA256 encoding is not correctly because SHA256 encoding and parsing to hex will always result this length of hashes. But in the given example the hashes are not that long. </p>

<p>What is the problem here? </p>

<p>I also use these helper functions:</p>

        }
        return CCHmacAlgorithm(result)
    }

        var result: CInt = 0

Once the key is known and the digest is known, is it possible to get the plain-text back? (pre-image attack without brute-force) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack</a></p>

<p>My intuition says NO as the block size (input size) is 512 bit and the output size is 256 bit. It means that to be a good hashing function (cryptographically) the function should be many to one function (non-invertible). {This is the exact opposite to the requirement of a block cipher where the function should be invertible (one to one).}</p>

<p>As far as I understood the requirement is to have random many-to-one function!</p>
","<p>It's impossible, even with Brute Force, to recover the plain text for a given hash because there are many texts that map to the same N-bit key (for any value of N).  That is, there are different messages that have the same digest value.</p>

<p>I looked for alternatives that work with</p>

<p>My search points me to: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/18678325"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/18678325</a></p>

<p>I tested bcrypt and I was interested how it works.</p>

<p>The explanation at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/6833165"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/6833165</a> points me to one question.</p>

<p>If <code>$2a$10$ZaDBCZaI59IMdKuBiRdubuMa2h/itIYIwqLHpS1q245ISD90xsjkW</code> contains all information about the type of encoding and the salt and so on, and this is stored in my database why is it save?
If someone has this ""hash"" he can easily decrypt it with brute force.</p>

<p>Within my previous project I used a SHA encode with a system wide secret salt. In this scenario the hash stole from the database can't easily be decrypted.</p>

<p>So why is bcrypt preferred to a SHA with system wide salt?</p>
","<p>2 points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bcrypt is designed to resist brute force attacks by having a configurable complexity that makes the process arbitrarily slow. Refer to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""wikipedia"">wikipedia</a> for more details</li>
<li>Using the same hash for all passwords, as your existing system does, may be vulnerable to differential attacks, since each password in the database is known to contain a shared component.</li>

<pre><code>import java.security.MessageDigest;

        try {

//          md.update(salt.getBytes(ENCODING));

        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thing is: when I leave the line <code>md.update()</code> commented out, this code gives me the exact <strong>same</strong> results as some <em>online hash generators</em> (like this <a href=""http://www.convertstring.com/Hash/SHA512"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one</a>).</p>

<p>For example, hashing the word ""whatever"" gives a hash value ae3d....63a.</p>

<p>But when I run my code with that salt operation; I get <strong>different</strong> results (again compared against that online tool, which allows to set a salt string, too).</p>

<p>My implementation results in 413...623; the online tool says F25...686.</p>

<p>Any explanation in which way ""salting"" leads to ""implementation specific"" results? </p>

<p>Is there something I should do differently in my code?</p>

","<p>Reposting my earlier comment (extended).</p>

<p>What you do is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read bytes</li>
<li>Convert them to characters</li>
<li>Split the character stream to lines</li>
<li>Store those lines into a list</li>
<li>Again concatenate those lines into a string</li>
<li>Take its bytes again</li>
<li>Compute hash of those bytes</li>
</ol>

<p>Steps 2-6 seem unnecessary. I would recommend to read bytes from your initial <code>FileInputStream</code> in chunks (for example, of 4k) and feed them to the <code>MessageDigest</code> for update. That would just perform steps 1 and 7.</p>

<pre><code>InputStream is = new FileInputStream(fileName);
byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
while (true) {
    int read = is.read(buffer);
    if (read &lt; 0) {
        break;
    }
    md.update(buffer, 0, read);
}
is.close(); // better be done in finally

"43102412","How does Git compute SHA hashes so quickly?","<p>I know git is fast but I have only recently found how fast it really can be.</p>

<p>In one of my projects, I am trying to compute SHA-256 hashes of a huge file (82 MB with 850k rows) and it took over a minute to compute it (includes hashing and a couple of other small operations). </p>

<p>Even with SHA-1, it took me 30+ seconds while git seems to be doing it in just a second or two.</p>

<p>I am computing the hash in Scala using java's <code>Security</code> API by combining all the lines of the file.</p>

<pre><code>val lines = Source.fromFile(filePath, ""UTF-8"").getLines().toList
MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"")
.digest(lines.mkString(""\n"").getBytes).map(""%02x"".format(_)).mkString
</code></pre>

<p>So, how does Git do it so quickly, or rather the more important question, why is my method so slow?</p>

<p>Edit: For those not familiar with scala syntax, <code>lines</code> will have all the lines of the file in a <code>List</code> and <code>mkString</code> method returns a string of all the elements in the list combined with the given separator. </p>
","<p>Git undoubtedly is faster, but 30 seconds for SHA-1 is not so great.</p>

<p>So I ran a test in java:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

    byte[] bytes = createSha1(new File(""src\\main\\resources\\200mb_file.zip""));
    System.out.println(new String(bytes));

    long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long duration = (endTime - startTime);
    System.out.format(""Duration: %dms\n"", duration);
}

private static byte[] createSha1(File file) throws Exception  {
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"");
    InputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
    int n = 0;
    byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
    while (n != -1) {
        n = fis.read(buffer);
        if (n &gt; 0) {
            digest.update(buffer, 0, n);
        }
    }
    return digest.digest();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Duration: 1531
</code></pre>

<p>My guess what is causing your slowness is the fact you are inputting it to a list rather the directly using it as a stream.</p>

"50282136","How do I represent uint8 literals in Java","<p>I am trying to re-implement some code that uses libsodium in Java.
The original code declares an array of type uint8:</p>

<pre><code>#define SECRET ((uint8_t[]){ 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC ... }) // not the real secret!
</code></pre>

<p>and feeds that to libsodium's <code>crypto_hash_sha256_update</code></p>

<p>My challenge in implementing this in Java is that Java has no unsigned bytes, so I can't actually type <code>0xAA</code> as a byte.</p>

<p>Things I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declaring my array as short/int: I think this breaks because of 0 padding</li>
<li>Declaring the literals as <code>0b11110000...</code> format, this doesn't give the right answers (I have some test data from the original implementation)</li>
<li>Declaring an array of <code>char []</code> and concatenating the literals: final char[] salt = { 0xAABB, 0xCCDD, ...}`, doesn't give right answers either</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT
this is my short attempt</p>

<pre><code>    final short[] salt = { 0xAA, 0xBB, ...};

    hasher.putLong(input);
    for (int i=0; i &lt; salt.length; i++) {
        hasher.putShort(salt[i]);

I tried googling around but did not get anything. In this Java code, I am passing URI and Key as arguments, to generate the hash code, where URI contains Timestamp. 
The java code is as :</p>

<pre><code>    public static String calcMAC(String data, byte[] key) throws Exception {
    String result=null;
    SecretKeySpec signKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, SecurityConstants.HMAC_SHA1_ALGORITHM);

    byte[] rawHmac;
    try {
        rawHmac = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(""US-ASCII""));
        result = Base64.encodeBase64String(rawHmac);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return result.trim();
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
    String timestamp = args[0];
    String key = ""d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180"";
    String out = null;

        out = calcMAC(""/req?app_id=47ca34"" + timestamp + ""=2018-05-22T12:02:15Z"",

        System.out.println(URLEncoder.encode(out, ""UTF-8""));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to achieve the same goal in NodeJs/JavaScript?</p>

<p>Note:: I have to call this script from Postman pre-request script.</p>
","<p>The crypto module should do this for you, you can substitute the 'data' variable with whatever you want to hash: </p>

<pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');

const data = 'The fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars';
const key = Buffer.from('d134hjeefcgkahvg32ajkdbaff84ff180', 'utf8');

const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha1', key).update(data).digest('base64');
const uriEncodedHash = encodeURIComponent(hash);
console.log('Hash: ' + uriEncodedHash);
</code></pre>

<p>Hashing the data in both Java and Node.js gives me the result (URI Encoded) of:</p>

<pre><code>TJJ3xj93m8bfVpGoucluMQqkB0o%3D
</code></pre>

<p>The same Java code would be:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String args[]) {
    String data = ""The fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars"";

    } catch (Exception e) {

<p>Because I'm trying to make a simple <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGET.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GET request</a> from an admin page on my website, I'm just trying to do this through Javascript.  Here are <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html#ConstructingTheCanonicalizedResourceElement"" rel=""nofollow"">the instructions</a> for constructing the Signature for the Authorization header:</p>

<pre><code>Signature = Base64( HMAC-SHA1( YourSecretAccessKeyID, UTF-8-Encoding-Of( StringToSign )     ))
</code></pre>

<p>To keep us sane, they give us a few examples, with the following givens:</p>

<pre><code>var AWSSecretAccessKey = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY,
    StringToSign = 'GET\n\n\nTue, 27 Mar 2007 19:36:42 +0000\n/johnsmith/photos/puppy.jpg;'
</code></pre>

<p>The output for this in their docs is <code>bWq2s1WEIj+Ydj0vQ697zp+IXMU=</code>.  Based on the following I am getting <code>ZGVjNzNmNTE0MGU4OWQxYTg3NTg0M2MxZDM5NjIyZDI0MGQxZGY0ZQ==</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function encode_utf8(s) {
  return unescape(encodeURIComponent(s));
}
</code></pre>

<p>I used <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#HMAC"" rel=""nofollow"">code.google.com's</a> CryptoJS.HmacSHA1 function for the SHA1 hashing.  My final Signature function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var signature = btoa( CryptoJS.HmacSHA1( aws_secret, encode_utf8( StringToSign) ) );
</code></pre>

<p>What is going wrong here???</p>
","<p>I actually found the answer from an <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4337959/need-hmac-sha1-encryption-library-for-javascript"">SO question</a> with reference to google's older (2.0) CrytpoJs library.  You need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/files/2.0.0-crypto-sha1.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2.0.0-crypto-sha1.js</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/files/2.0.0-hmac-min.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2.0.0-hmac-min.js</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Then you create your signature as so:</p>

<pre><code>Signature = btoa( Crypto.HMAC(Crypto.SHA1, encode_utf8(StringToSign), aws_secret, { asString: true }) )
</code></pre>

<p>I couldn't find a way to to get Strings instead of Bits in the new version.</p>

<p>My idea is to upload only modified files to an FTP server to save connection bandwidth.</p>

<p>In the same time I want to anonymise the files, putting them into a ""clean slate"" or anonymous archive that doesn't contain any operating system information whatsoever (mostly of these information is contained in hidden files like lists of file logs, system informations, icons data, etc..), it takes a few seconds, for any operating system to write in any downloaded folder, but it can not access an archive or zipped folder.</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell Git to make a package (zip archive) of all files and folders being committed (modified) since a particular revision number (SHA) to the most recent version (HEAD)? </p>

<p>I want only those three files to be exported in an archive: </p>

","<p>Yes, the code <em>should</em> be unique, unless you're generating more than one per user per second. It's also terrifically <strong>predictable</strong>. If an attacker knows the id of a user and the <em>rough</em> time of when the code is being generated, it's trivial to guess the code.

"6671926","Using an HMAC on an a already hashed value, good or bad practice?","<p>Hi all I have a question on if this is good practice or not.  I am aware that simply double hashing a value can be bad for various reasons.</p>

<p>What I would like to do would be something like this, in php.</p>

<pre><code>$val = hash_hmac('sha256', md5($password), $salt);
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is that we are authenticating with a trusted partner over a closed api.  The passwords are stored as an MD5 hash in our DB.  However, I don't want our partner to send this same value across the net.</p>

<p>This way I can compare the md5'd password inside our database to unique hash that our partner has sent.</p>

<p>What say ye?</p>
","<p>First of all, is this a user password (ie, you are authenticating on-behalf-of a user), or a shared secret between your two servers?</p>

<p>If it's a user password, stop. You are saving passwords in plaintext (or as an unsalted md5). Either way is bad. Save passwords as a salted hash and use OAuth or something to authenticate instead.</p>

<p>If it's a shared secret between two servers (not representing a user), you can still use oauth or something, but if you just want something simple, you should authenticate like this:</p>

<pre><code>$val = hash_hmac('sha256', $nonce, $secret);
</code></pre>

<p><code>$nonce</code> is a one-time-value chosen by the server randomly to prevent replay attacks.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you don't have a nonce, then whatever value you send across <em>is</em> your shared secret. It doesn't matter if you derive it from a hmac of a md5 or whatever; if it ends up being the same each time, it is equivalent to a password sent across the communications channel. And remember to secure the communications channel from MITMs as well!</p>

<p>if I only want good bit mixing of some input entropy for seeding a non-cryptographic PRNG? Security is completely irrelevant. All I need is to generate a good PRNG state from a time stamp combined with some hardware bits (8 byte time stamp, 56 bytes from hardware).</p>
","<p>While I'm not sure about the specifics of how you want to simplify things, generally simplifying a cryptographic algorithm for non-cryptographic purposes is just fine provided you <em>document very clearly</em> that your use of a cryptographic primitive does not imply any cryptographic strength in the resulting code.</p>

<p>Normally you might implement the exact specification so that you can verify it against a third-party reference (ensuring that the code is connected as expected and that no data is discarded, etc.), and then reduce the number of rounds so it goes much faster.</p>

<p>A common motivation for doing this is when you have access to hardware acceleration for a cryptographic algorithm.</p>

<p>However, if your input is a fixed-length 64 bits then sha256 is typically more trouble than it's worth.</p>

<p>You haven't specified the size of the state of the PRNG.  If it's bigger than 64 bits then you probably just want to seed a simple 64-bit PRNG with your seed and then use that iteratively to fill in the larger PRNG state buffer.  If it's exactly 64-bits then something like the mix function of MurmurHash might be sufficient.</p>

  <p><a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/2880823.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Security Advisory 2880823</a> has been released along with the
  policy announcement that Microsoft will stop recognizing the validity
  of SHA-1 based certificates after 2016.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it mean that all signatures created with SHA1 algorithm will be not valid?<br>
Or only certificates used the SHA-1 algorithm will be not valid in newer operation systems?  </p>
","<p>The latter.</p>

<p>It would be very strange if the cryptographic security provider would not be able to handle PKCS#1 signatures with SHA1 anymore. What will happen is that <em>certificate chain validation</em> will not allow the SHA-1 signature to be used for certificate verification (except for the trusted/root certificate, because these are explicitly trusted in the first place).</p>

<p>As stated in the advisory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new policy will no longer allow root certificate authorities to issue X.509 certificates using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm for the purposes of SSL and code signing after January 1, 2016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to only affect intermediate CA certificates although I would not be surprised if e.g. IE would also disallow the use of SHA-1 for chain validation for lower intermediate CA's and end user certificates.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/11/04/sha-1-deprecation-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">updates</a> also indicate that Microsoft won't allow any certificates to be signed using SHA-1 within a chain <em>for TLS</em>.</p>

<p>As for the ""newer operating systems"" part of the question: I would expect policy change to be implemented for all supported platforms (at the time the change is introduced).</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that the use of SHA-1 for signature verification will be pretty dangerous, especially if the contents can be controlled. This is very much the case when the signature is used for non-repudiation. It is much less the case if the signature is used for e.g. challenge verification in a challenge response protocol where the input is ephemeral and generated by the party that performs the verification.</p>

"38314245","Why is there a '1' in the padding of SHA-2","<p>I'm looking at the SHA-256 algorithm. The padding consists of a single '1', followed by as many 0's as needed to made the size of the block congruent to 448 mod(512), and then the size of the message (excluding the 1 and the padding) as a 64 bit unsigned integer. </p>

<p>I'm unclear as to the reason for the '1'. A reason that pops-up in unofficial sources is that it serves to prevent birthday attacks but the lenght at the end seems suffiscient to that purpose. 
Elsewhere it is said that the 1 is needed to make the padding Merkle–Damgård-compliant (MD-compliant) but unless something really eluded me the size feild at the end is clearly suffiscient. 
see: 
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction#MD-compliant_padding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction#MD-compliant_padding</a></p>

<p>Finally a source wrote that this was necessary to process an empty string (why?) and another to make the padding reversible (what for?).
I'm always suspicious when I find so many different explainations. Can anyone explain me this with an example.</p>

<p>BTW, this padding is defined in ISO/IEC 9797-1 as Padding Method 2 (with no explainations). </p>

<p>Try <code>PKCS7_add_signature</code>. From <code>&lt;openssl dir&gt;/crypto/pkcs7/pkcs7.h</code>:</p>

<pre><code>PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO *PKCS7_add_signature(PKCS7 *p7, X509 *x509,

<p>The implementation is in <code>pk7_lib.c</code>, which can be found at <code>&lt;openssl dir&gt;/crypto/pkcs7/pk7_lib.c</code>. There's not much to the function. It looks like the heavy lifting is done by <code>PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO_set</code>.</p>

<p>Its used in a few places in the library. There is no demo in <code>apps/</code>:</p>

","<p>MD5 and SHA are hash functions, they create fingerprint - fixed-length representation - from the bunch of data. For example, they are extensively used as a way to check consistency of your iso image downloads for many open-source products, but this means you can use them to create fingerprints from any selection of bytes. So they do not encrypt.</p>

<p>If you want to encrypt, you should check for encryption algorithms. The most feasible now I believe is AES (Advanced encryption Standard) if you look for symmetric encryption algorithms (eg. where key for encryption and decryption is the same or easily computed one from another) or RSA if you look for asymmetric (where you have 2 keys - public and private, and compute private key from public is hard task).</p>

<p>If you are about to create digital signatures, you may want to check things like DSA (digital signature algorithm) and ECDSA (DSA over elliptic curves.). Note that asymmetric algorithms work over numbers with extended precision - like 512, 1024, 2048 bits and so on. You need special libraries that can handle such numbers. If you use C++ I can recommend you trying Crypto++. Find something similar for other languages. </p>

","<p>If your data is password and you want to store it some where then Use <code>MD5</code> or <code>SHA</code> Hash.
There are two advantages of these. </p>

<ol>
<li>A hash can not be decrypted to recover old value so your password will never ever will be cracked even if you provide MD5/SHA hash of password to some one :) </li>
<li>A hash of particular string will be always same so you can compare passwords based on Hash.</li>
</ol>

<p>AES :</p>

<ol>
<li>Symmetric algorithm so faster</li>
<li>Use with PKCS5Padding and CBC mode </li>
<li>Always store IV</li>
<li>Symmetric so you need same key while you are decrypting encrypted text so you can not at all share keys.</li>

<p>RSA</p>

<ol>
<li>PKI Infrastructure to exchange Keys</li>
<li>Slow</li>

","<p>This is the problem:</p>

<p>This will lose any leading 0s - in other words, any byte less than 16 will come out as a single hex digit instead of two.</p>

<p>There are plenty of fixes for this. For example:</p>

<li>Manually append <code>0</code> if the value is between 0 and 15 (ick)</li>
<li>Use <code>String.format(""%02x"", bytes[i] &amp; 0xff)</code></li>

"40190282","Generate C* bucket hash from multipart primary key","<p>I will have C* tables that will be very wide. To prevent them to become too wide  I have encountered a strategy that could suit me well. It was presented in this video.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqf25DDAXdk"" rel=""nofollow"">Bucket Your Partitions Wisely</a></p>

<p>The good thing with this strategy is that there is no need for a ""look-up-table"" (it is fast), the bad part is that one needs to know the max amount of buckets and eventually end up with no more buckets to use (not scalable). I know my max bucket size so I will try this.</p>

<p>By calculating a hash from the tables primary keys this can be used as a bucket part together with the rest of the primary keys.</p>

<p>I have come up with the following method to be sure (I think?) that the hash always will be the same for a specific primary key.</p>

<p><strong>Using Guava Hashing:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static String bucket(List&lt;String&gt; primKeyParts, int maxBuckets) {

    StringBuilder combinedHashString = new StringBuilder();
    primKeyParts.forEach(part -&gt;{
        combinedHashString.append(
            String.valueOf(
                Hashing.consistentHash(Hashing.sha512()
                    .hashBytes(part.getBytes()), maxBuckets)
            )
        );
    });
    return combinedHashString.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I use sha512 is to be able to have strings with max characters of 256 (512 bit) otherwise the result will never be the same (as it seems according to my tests).</p>

<p>I am far from being a hashing guru, hence I'm asking the following questions.</p>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Between different JVM executions on different nodes/machines the result should always be the same for a given Cassandra primary key?</p>

<ol>
<li>Can I rely on the mentioned method to do the job?</li>
<li>Is there a better solution of hashing large strings so they always will produce the same result for a given string?</li>
<li>Do I always need to hash from string or could there be a better way of doing this for a C* primary key and always produce same result?</li>
</ol>

<p>Please, I don't want to discuss data modeling for a specific table, I just want to have a bucket strategy.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Elaborated further and came up with this so the length of string can be arbitrary. What do you say about this one?</p>

<pre><code>public static int murmur3_128_bucket(int maxBuckets, String... primKeyParts) {

    List&lt;HashCode&gt; hashCodes = new ArrayList();
    for(String part : primKeyParts) {
        hashCodes.add(Hashing.murmur3_128().hashString(part, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    };
    return Hashing.consistentHash(Hashing.combineOrdered(hashCodes), maxBuckets);
}
</code></pre>
","<p>I currently use a similar solution in production. So for your method I would change to:</p>

<pre><code>public static int bucket(List&lt;String&gt; primKeyParts, int maxBuckets) {
  String keyParts = String.join("""", primKeyParts);
  return Hashing.consistentHash(
                     Hashing.murmur3_32().hashString(keyParts, Charsets.UTF_8),
                     maxBuckets);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the differences</p>

<ol>
<li>Send all the PK parts into the hash function at once.</li>
<li>We actually set the max buckets as a code constant since the consistent hash is only if the max buckets stay the same.</li>
<li>We use MurMur3 hash since we want it to be fast not cryptographically strong.</li>
</ol>

<p>For your direct questions 1) Yes the method should do the job. 2) I think with the tweaks above you should be set. 3) The assumption is you need the whole PK? </p>

<p>I'm not sure you need to use the whole primary key since the expectation is that your partition part of your primary key is gonna be the same for many things which is why you are bucketing. You could just hash the bits that will provide you with good buckets to use in your partition key. In our case we just hash some of the clustering key parts of the PK to generate the bucket id we use as part of the partition key.</p>

","<p>TL;DR: you are safe unless you mix VCSes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem statement in your question is not quite right in the first place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... it appears what very unlikely what two different commits in git will have same hash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this (indirectly) leads to a faulty further assumption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what about all commits not only git? My application working with git,svn,hg - can i assume that there will be no different commits with same hash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if all VCSes were perfect, you could not really make this assumption.  Even if all VCSes were both perfect <em>and</em> used the same hash <em>algorithm</em>, you still could not make this assumption.  But for your particular problem, there is a much simpler (albeit imperfect) answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For now i'm trying to deside how stop my application from creation same commits from different forks of one repo in db ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main thing to consider here is the concept of ""forks of one repo"", and how you are going to identify a particular commit.</p>

<p>If we look at the identity of a commit in Git or Mercurial, we find that it <em>is</em> a hash ID.</p>

<p>Two objects in Git that have the same object-ID <em>are</em> the same object, by definition, because Git will store any object only once.  This is because the underlying storage model for Git is a simple key-value store, with the key being a hash ID.  There is only one value stored under any single key.</p>

<p>To allow for the four object types in Git—commit, annotated tag, tree, and blob—Git stores the object's type in a header prepended to all objects.  It makes the assumption that prepending the string <code>commit &lt;size&gt;\0</code> to some data results in a different hash than prepending the string <code>blob &lt;size&gt;\0</code> to the same data.  This assumption is largely true, though the pigeonhole principle tells us that there must be some data for which it is false.  (To the extent that SHA-1 is good, the chance of finding a data-pair that generates a collision is 1 in 2<sup>160</sup>.  The Stevens et al work shows that SHA-1 is not that good.)</p>

<p>In any case, though, Git's underlying storage model means that once a key has an associated value, <em>that key/value pair is now occupied</em>, and no pair with the <em>same</em> key can be stored again.  Hence, if some existing key <em>k</em> exists, and has type <em>commit</em> and represents some commit, no new object of <em>any</em> type with key <em>k</em> can be added to the repository database (at least not without first removing the existing object with key <em>k</em>).</p>

<p>What this means is that if you make the assumption that commits are not removed, and if you have seen that key <em>k</em> exists before in any clone of this repository, any <em>other</em> clone with key <em>k</em> has the <em>same</em> object.  The hash, in other words, <em>is</em> the object, in a very real sense.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily the case in Mercurial.  Mercurial's database <em>can</em> store new commits that have duplicate keys (the simple local sequence number associated with each object can disambiguate them).  However, such commits can never be transferred from one repository to another (and are likely to cause other problems), so you are certainly allowed to assume the problem away if the repository will be distributed.</p>

<p>Currently, both Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 as well—but they use them in <em>different ways</em>.  That is, the input message on which the hash is computed differs in Git vs Mercurial.  What <em>this</em> means is that if you have ""forks"" <em>G</em> (stored via Git) and <em>M</em> (stored via Mercurial) that represent the same <em>repository</em>, the keys <em>k<sub>G</sub></em> in <em>G</em> are (numerically) <em>unrelated to</em> the keys <em>k<sub>M</sub></em> in <em>M</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you allow two different forks to use two different underlying VCSes, you cannot make the assumption that two different keys represent two different objects, nor that two identical keys represent the same object.  If you constrain them to the <em>same</em> VCS, though, you may make this assumption.</p>

<p>(SVN does not identify commits by hashes at all.  Since SVN repositories are centralized, they can and do use a simple unique integer to represent each commit.  By converting the SVN repository to a Git repository, however, you impose the Git restrictions: you now have a repository that meets any restrictions imposed by <em>both</em> VCSes.  Should someone add a new commit to the SVN repository that cannot be represented correctly in the Git repository, it simply never goes into the Git repository at all.)</p>

","<p>No, there are no out of band hash values for MD5, SHA-1 or one of the SHA-2 candidates. The output of cryptograhic hashes is guaranteed to be indistinguishable from random. That said, if you generate a value of the same size as e.g. SHA-256 (32 bytes) <em>that is not already a known hash</em>, then you are guaranteed that nobody else will generate the same value. This could even be 32 bytes set to all zeros. There are endless messages that will generate the hash value you chose, the point is that it is impossible to find one.</p>

<p>If anybody would be able to generate a hash that has the same value then they would be able to generate a collision. If a collision can be generated then the cryptographic hash is considered broken. MD5 does have collisions and <strong>is</strong> considered broken. For SHA-1 there have been no collisions yet, but the amount of work required to generate one is lower than expected for a hash with 160 bit output, and possibly already inside reach. Neither MD5 or SHA1 is <em>currently</em> so broken that you would be able to generate any random hash value, but attacks only get better, not worse.</p>

<p>So in the end you would be best off choosing SHA-256 or SHA-512 for this particular purpose. Note that although you can use just X leftmost bytes of the output, you should use at least 160 bits or so to be reasonably sure that there is no collision - for non-broken hash algorithms the output size determines the chance of collisions.</p>

<p>The way in which you construct the <code>api-signature</code> value is also different for GET requests to this API - see <a href=""https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiKeysUsage#full-sample-calculation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for details. The changes I have suggested should lead to the correct signature being generated.

<p>Other issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Dim a, b As String</code> is equivalent to <code>Dim a As Variant, b As String</code>. To declare multiple String variables you need to write <code>Dim a As String, b As String</code></li>
<li><code>CreateObject(""MSXML2.XMLHTTP"")</code> accesses the older version 3.0 of MSXML2. To access the most recent version 6.0, you need <code>CreateObject(""MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0"")</code></li>

","<p>In your Oracle query, you're generating multiple random byte strings.</p>

<p>Try this to demonstrate: </p>

<pre><code>select RAND, RAND, RAND, DBMS_CRYPTO.HASH(RAND, 6 /*SHA512*/) as sha512 from 
    (select DBMS_CRYPTO.RANDOMBYTES(5) as RAND from DUAL);

<p>Note the three different values for RAND. So the hash you are generating is actually for a different byte sequence than you think it is.</p>

<p>To fix it, you can use this bit of trickery courtesy of AskTom</p>

<pre><code>select RAND,DBMS_CRYPTO.HASH(RAND, 6 /*SHA512*/) as sha512 from 
    (select rownum, DBMS_CRYPTO.RANDOMBYTES(5) as RAND from DUAL);

<p>including rownum in the subquery makes RAND consistent each time you use it as a field in the top level SELECT.</p>

"16634295","Password security","<p>Currently I am using a particular scheme for securing passwords, and I think I have some points for improvement. The implementation is in Java, so I prefer to use SHA-2 512 as encryption form.</p>

<p>Currently I have a client-server model, so these things can happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client wants to login, he sends his password with one time normal SHA-2 512 encryption over the network.</li>
<li>The server has the passwords stored in the database as for example SHA-2_512(SHA-2_512(password) + salt), with the inner SHA-2_512(password) being the 'encrypted' password it receives over the network.</li>
<li>Password checks are done server side and there is no way anything can leak out from the server, the only possible vulnerability would be if someone could read out the RAM I think.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An attacker usually creates collision attacks when wanting to hack a password. However how are collision attacks sufficient? If the password needs to be used for other applications like Outlook.com, Facebook or whatever (which likely use another salt as they have nothing to do with my applications), how is a collision attack enough then? Don't you need the real password?</p></li>
<li><p>Does SHA-2 512 already use iteration? And even if so, should I change my encryption methods to automatically use a number of iterations plus how many iterations is preferred? I have also read about using a random number of iterations (in a range), how do I store the random factor determenistically?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I store system secrets for every iteration in the server code? See <a href=""http://blog.mozilla.org/webappsec/2011/05/10/sha-512-w-per-user-salts-is-not-enough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mozilla.org/webappsec/2011/05/10/sha-512-w-per-user-salts-is-not-enough/</a> . I could store an array which would hold a static secret for every iteration, with the nth secret being for the nth iteration. Nobody can know the secrets, they are computed once (I guess as encrypting some random string), and then basically stored in the Server's RAM.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently I send the typed password from the client to the server as just SHA-2_512(password), should this process be improved, and if so, how? I cannot use salts, because the client does not have the salt available.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Regards.</p>
","<p>TLDR: You need to send the password using an encrypted channel, such as TLS.  Consider using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""noreferrer"">bcrypt</a> for password hashing.</p>

<p>SHA-2 512 is not an encryption algortihm, it is a message digest algorithm.  An encryption algorithm requires a key and a message to encrypt.  It produces ciphertext.  The important thing is that an encryption algorithm has a decryption algorithm.</p>

<pre><code>ciphertext = E(key, plaintext);
plaintext = D(key, ciphertext);
</code></pre>

<p>A message digest takes a piece of plaintext and produces a message digest.  There is no corresponding reverse mechanism to take a message digest and retrieve the original message.  There is also no secret key.</p>

<pre><code>digest = hash(plaintext);
</code></pre>

<p>If an attacker is able to access a database with hashes, the attacker can retrieve the original password by brute forcing, trying lots of guesses with the hash algorithm.</p>

<pre><code>digest1 = hash(guess1);
digest2 = hash(guess2);    //repeat with lots of guesses
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, sending a hash over a network is <em>not</em> secure.  It needs to be sent through some secure communications mechanism such as SSL.  If an attacker can intercept the hash over the communications they may be able to work out the orignal password.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">hash collision</a> is not the same as brute forcing the password.  A hash collision is caused when two <em>different</em> messages produce the same message digest.</p>

<pre><code>digest1 = hash(plaintext1);
digest2 = hash(plaintext2);
if ( ( plaintext1 != plaintext2 ) &amp;&amp; ( digest1 == digest2 ) )  
    // hash collision
</code></pre>

<p>SHA-512 does not have iterations designed to prevent brute-forcing.  The SHA set of algorithms are designed to be efficient.  The reason for adding iterations when hashing passwords is to increase the time it takes to brute force a password.  The idea being the cost to perform a legitimate login attempt and perform 100 iterations is tiny compared to an attacker who has millions of passwords, each of which requires 100 iterations.  Adding more iterations helps reduce the impact of improved processor speeds (which would help an attacker try more iterations quicker).</p>

<p>You should make the number of iterations a configurable limit that is stored against each user.  So you store the password hash, salt and iteration count for each user.  This means that in the future you can increase the number of iterations to take into account increased hardware power.</p>

<p>Sending the SHA-2 512 in plaintext is not secure.  You should send it within an encrypted channel, such as SSL.</p>

<p>Having said all that, SHA-2 is not designed to be a password hashing algorithm.  It is designed for message validation and is to be efficient.  Consider using a purpose built password hashing algorithm.  One example is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""noreferrer"">bcrypt</a>.  It is designed to be computationally difficult and has salt and iterations built in.</p>

"53205272","How to get algorithm field from signed PE PKCS#7 block","<p>I've got <code>PKCS#7</code> content extracted from PE file. </p>

<p>The first part before the certificate chain (goes from the beginning up to the <code>cert:</code> label), contains info about the file integrity.</p>

","<p>Defined in <a href=""https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1/include/openssl/pkcs7.h#L61"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>pkcs7.h</code></a>, the <code>md_algs</code> attribute that you are inspecting is a stack of <code>X509_ALGOR</code> instances:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct pkcs7_signed_st {
    ASN1_INTEGER *version;      /* version 1 */
    STACK_OF(X509_ALGOR) *md_algs; /* md used */
    STACK_OF(X509) *cert;       /* [ 0 ] */
    STACK_OF(X509_CRL) *crl;    /* [ 1 ] */
    STACK_OF(PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO) *signer_info;
    struct pkcs7_st *contents;
} PKCS7_SIGNED;
</code></pre>

<p>It can be safely accessed via the <a href=""https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/STACK_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenSSL Stack API</a>, for example using the function <code>sk_X509_ALGOR_value()</code> to inspect its element(s).</p>

<p><code>X509_ALGOR</code> itself is defined in <a href=""https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1/include/openssl/x509.h#L59"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>x509.h</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct X509_algor_st {
    ASN1_OBJECT *algorithm;
    ASN1_TYPE *parameter;
} /* X509_ALGOR */ ;
</code></pre>

<p>The information you are looking for is stored in the property <code>algorithm</code>, which you can inspect using, for example, <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/OBJ_obj2txt.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>OBJ_obj2txt()</code></a>.</p>

<p>Tying it together, to get a textual representation of the first algorithm in the stack, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>char tbuf[20];
X509_ALGOR *algor = sk_X509_ALGOR_value(Pkcs7-&gt;d.sign-&gt;md_algs, 0);
int res = OBJ_obj2txt(tbuf, sizeof tbuf, algor-&gt;algorithm, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>After that, <code>tbuf</code> should contain a value like <code>""sha1""</code> and <code>res</code> contains the length of that string. For programmatic purposes, a function like <code>OBJ_obj2nid()</code> is probably more useful.</p>

<hr>

<p>The debugger did not give you this information because the <code>data</code> field in the <code>stack</code> element is not strongly typed. You would have to cast it yourself to indicate that it is an array of pointers to <code>X509_ALGOR</code> structs. The OpenSSL Stack API provides you a set of macros that do the casting for you and access the array that way. And then, the <code>ASN1_OBJECT</code> that you end up with is hard to inspect or interpret in the debugger since it is just a bunch of bytes representing an object id in <code>ASN.1</code> format.</p>

Thanks for your help! It is not pretty but does work for now.</p>

  fracPart2 &lt;&lt;= 4;                                        // shift to correct value

<p>This solution is highly platform dependant and in a second approach i am going for something like in the link of comment 2.</p>

<p><strong>Edit3</strong></p>

<p>So this is my final solution, which does not depend on the internal representation of a double and calculates the fraction just using math.</p>

<pre><code>uint32_t getFractionalPart(double value)
{
  uint32_t retValue = 0;

  for (uint8_t i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
  {
    value = value - floor(value);
    retValue &lt;&lt;= 4;
    value *= 16;
    retValue += floor(value);
  }

  return retValue;
}
</code></pre>
","<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the double here is 64 bits. 
If you look at the IEEE representation of doubles at the below link, it has 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and the remaining are the precision bits.</p>

<p>Now when you look at the output you've gotten, take a look at the nibbles I've put in quotes, do they look familiar?
The reason the number is backwards is because of endianness. The 12th bit is where the fractional part is starting in this case, and then it moves backwards.</p>

<p>I'm reading the Botan documentation and found an example somewhat similar to what I need but I'm having difficulties adapting it.</p>

<p>I need to encrypt the XML in SHA1+RSA using the certificates and encode the result in Base64.</p>

<p>The official documentation provide examples in many languages unfortunately C++ is not one of them, I use the php example as start point to create my PoC code in C++.</p>

<p>The exact problem is this.</p>

<p>I have this XML example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;loginTicketRequest version=""1.0""&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;uniqueId&gt;1560949868&lt;/uniqueId&gt;&lt;generationTime&gt;2019-06-19T10:10:08-03:00&lt;/generationTime&gt;&lt;expirationTime&gt;2019-06-19T10:12:08-03:00&lt;/expirationTime&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;service&gt;wsfe&lt;/service&gt;&lt;/loginTicketRequest&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this XML became in this Base64 string </p>

<p>I need to encrypt the XML in SHA1+RSA using the certificates and encode the result in Base64. Any help will be very appreciated.</p>
","<p>I'm a little bit confused about your main question. Guess you have to mention it more obvious. But as I noticed the problem is how to encrypt using your public RSA key and <code>SHA-1</code> hash function! (Am I right?)</p>

<p>So in that case I would say the <code>EME1(SHA-256)</code> that you could see in encryptor/decryptor objects aren't the bulk encryption algorithm and hash function used for encryption. They are padding algorithms!</p>

<p>In Botan there are <strong>tls_channel</strong> and <strong>tls_callbacks</strong> which handle the whole process of encryption and decryption between two sides. Take a further look at them.</p>

<p>Also if Botan is not mandatory I suggest you to use <strong>Openssl</strong> in <code>evp.h</code> file the function <code>EVP_SealInit</code> will may help you by letting pick your desired algorithm with <code>const EVP_CIPHER *type</code> input. For more info <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/EVP_SealFinal.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check this link</a></p>

"18077729","Hashing and using time as salt to prevent access from un-authorized system and replay attacks","<p>I am currently writing a user authentication API for a mobile game. I'd want to make sure that the user can only access the system from the mobile app. (That is, the server has to deny access if the Server API is accessed from browser or CURL (un-authorized system) even though the exact POST parameters are valid). Ideally, the system should not allow replay attacks as well.</p>

<p>Does anybody have idea or example of how this can be done?</p>

<p>I am thinking of adding a unique-per-user salt with current timestamp and SHA256-ing the parameters with a private key on the client app, which will then be validated on the server. This way will prevent the access from browser or CURL as attackers will need to get the private key in order to compute the SHA256 hash. The salt (which includes timestamp) will also be sent as one of the params, and the server will get the timestamp and deny access if it is past a certain time. But I am not very sure about the security and whether it is the common or correct practice, as I've never design secured app, or seen the source code of one before.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input!</p>
","<p>This will stop users from intercepting requests on network and using them with CURL. But both private key and signature algorithm can be extracted for your app and reimplemented, so this solution will not be totally secure. </p>

<p>Alas, you can't have complete security here without some custom tamper-resistant hardware issued to users.</p>

"11059773","Where does hashing take place with a webclient and LDAP","<p>We are currently implementing several web application that requires the user to create a user login that will be authenticated through LDAP calls. The LDAP server and user accounts will be shared by all the applications and the user's credentials will be the same across all applications.</p>

<p>My question is where does the hashing take place in a standard LDAP scenario, on the client side or does the LDAP server take care of it. It was my understanding that the LDAP server takes in a user password, at the time of creation, and hashes it and stores it. (By the by we plan on using salted SHA512 hashing and SSL connections between the client > webserver > LDAp server)</p>

<p>It was my understanding that the hashing operation takes place centrally on the LDAP server, relieving the client of the trouble and avoiding any breakage on the client end to affect other apps.</p>
","<p>Modern, professional-quality servers use storage schemes for password attributes (usually <code>userPassword</code> and <code>authPassword</code>) that involve executing the hash on the server. Servers usually append or prepend a unique value (called a salt) to a password, then execute the hash function. The ""salt"" minimizes the effectiveness of dictionary attacks, that is, dictionaries are more difficult to create for salted, hashed passwords.</p>

<p>SSL (a secure connection) should be used, or a non-secure connection should be promoted using the StartTLS extended request. An encrypted connection should be used so that passwords can be transmitted in the clear with BIND requests. Passwords that are transmitted in the clear over a secure connection can be checked for history and quality by the servers' password policy enforcement mechanisms. For servers that enforce password history and quality checks, passwords should not be transmitted pre-encoded. Therefore, it is not so much the ""trouble"" to the LDAP client as it is the fact that the server can enforcement organization-wide and agreed-to password quality and history checks in a central location.</p>

","<p>You need to add a lot more masking here to cut down overflowing bits. For example, your <code>ROTR</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return (x &gt;&gt; n) | (x &lt;&lt; w - n)
</code></pre>

<p>leaves all the high bits of <code>x</code> intact above the <code>w</code> boundary; you'd want to construct a mask from <code>w</code> and mask off the high bits, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>def ROTR(x, n, w=32):
    return ((x &gt;&gt; n) | (x &lt;&lt; w - n)) &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; w) - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Similar masks are needed anytime you might have overflowed the assumed ""register width"". They can also replace the error-prone use of <code>% math.pow(2, 32)</code> you've got going on, changing:</p>

<pre><code>int((temp1 + temp2) % math.pow(2, 32))
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>(temp1 + temp2) &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; 32) - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>or equivalently:</p>

<pre><code>(temp1 + temp2) % 2 ** 32
</code></pre>

<p>This also needs to happen for bitwise negation where the overflow isn't as obvious: Python's <code>int</code>s are infinite precision, and bitwise negation of a non-negative value makes a negative value, effectively adding infinite <code>1</code> bits on the left (in the pseudo-two's complement behavior the language specifies). So <code>~x</code> must become <code>~x &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; 32) - 1)</code> or the like to force it back to a positive value containing only the low 32 bits.</p>

<p>This has to be done globally (so <code>temp1</code> and <code>temp2</code> are actually <code>int</code>, not <code>float</code> values when you compute with them). In general, <code>math.pow</code> is completely useless; you either want to use the <code>**</code> operator (which doesn't coerce to <code>float</code> and executes more efficiently) or the built-in <code>pow</code> function (which is only needed for its three argument for doing efficient modular exponentiation).</p>

"52873029","What is the data type of SHA-a output?","<p><strong>SHA-1</strong> produces <strong>a 160-bit</strong> <em>(20-byte</em>) hash value known as a message digest – typically rendered as <em>a hexadecimal number</em>, <em>40 digits long</em>, so is this (<em>20-byte</em>) of hex value as an array or just normal hex value? </p>

<p>This is my code: so what is the datatype of the output:</p>

<pre><code>import java.security.MessageDigest; 
public class MessageDigestExample {
public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception{

String input = ""This is a message"";
MessageDigest hash = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");

System.out.println(""digest : "" + Utils.toHex(hash.digest()));
</code></pre>

<p>} } </p>
","<p>I'm not sure I've understood your question but here are some answers:</p>

<p>When you use a SHA-1 hash function, it converts some value you gave it in input, into another value. Whereas your input value can be as long as you want, the digest result will be fixed (your 160-bits result). </p>

<p>As I understand your question, you want to give some ""type"" to what you set in input and what you get in output. I think that's the point you misunderstand: whatever data you set in input, they are juste bits (or bytes if you prefer to group them). What you get in output are also bits (or bytes). Then, it is your choice to represent them as you prefer: as an hexadecimal value, or as several hexadecimal values put into an array. It's up to you ;)</p>

<p>In your code example, according to <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a> :</p>

<pre><code>import java.security.MessageDigest; 
public class MessageDigestExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{

    String input = ""This is a message"";
    MessageDigest hash = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");

    //Here ""input"" is a String
    System.out.println(""input : "" + input);
    //Here you convert your ""input"" String into a byte array
    hash.update(Utils.toByteArray(input));
    //Here you get the ""hash.digest()"" result, which is an byte array, then you convert it into some hexadecimal value
    //(just check the library documentation where ""Utils.toHex()"" function comes from to know what it returns exactly).
    //Finally you cast it into a String value as you print it.
    System.out.println(""digest : "" + Utils.toHex(hash.digest()));

<p>So far i am looking Into. Anti-bruteforce and my professor gave me a hint about HTTPS.</p>

<p>Also how would i validate a log in if the password is sha+salt encrypted.</p>
","<p>Being the salt just a random string added to the hash of the string you want to encode, there are enough ways to generate it [e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2235434/how-to-generate-a-random-long-salt-for-use-in-hashing"">this on SO</a>].</p>

<p>You don't need and you can't decrypt any sha result because sha [like md5] is an <strong>hashing</strong> algorithm, not a <strong>crypt</strong> function, i.e. it's not meant to hide anything for later retrieval: this is important because I don't want the admin of a site I am registered to to read my password from database.</p>

<p>To hash is to map elements from a data set to shorter elements from another one, in an [almost total] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">injective way</a> - you map arbitrary long strings to fixed-length keys: this lets you make comparison in the hashed domain without actually knowing the original value.</p>

<pre><code>hash( value1 ) = hash ( value2 ) =&gt; value1 = value2
</code></pre>

<p>I said <em>almost</em> because hashing algorithms have some collisions [e.g. exceptions to previous statement such as <code>hash(value1) = hash(value2)</code> does not imply the 2 values being the same] - salts help in this regard too.</p>

<p>This said, this is how you save the password to db:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate the salt;</li>
<li><strong>prepend</strong> the salt to the actual password: it's important to put it <em>before</em> the pwd to prevent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dictionary attacks</a>;</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hash</a> the concatenated string with a proper algorithm [I chose <code>sha1</code> just for example's sake];</li>
<li>save both the string and the salt to db.</li>
</ul>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>$user -&gt; salt = your_salt_generator();
$user -&gt; hashedPwd = hash('sha1', $salt . $userChosenPwd);
</code></pre>

<p>Pwd checking against <code>$username</code> / <code>$password</code> is just:</p>

<ul>
<li>get user with given <code>$username</code> from db;</li>
<li>if it exists, use process above with saved salt and given password and check if it equals stored hash.</li>
</ul>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>hash('sha1', $user -&gt; salt . $sentPassword) == $user -&gt; hashedPwd;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>About hiding values in URLs, it's more a SEO / readability topic than a security one: URLs should be made upon routing [e.g. <code>http://somesite.com/products/:id</code> to access the id-th product], and your server logic should not be vulnerable to stuff put into requests that are made to your site [regardless to totally crap cases I can't come with right now].</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding MySQL injections, we got rid of them since <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prepared statements</a> from <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDO extension</a>.</p>

<p>There are millions of answers about this around SO, just have a look around.</p>

<p>I think the handler-level function will look like: </p>

<pre><code>fileMove fInfo (basePath &lt;&gt; generateSha fInfo)
</code></pre>

<p>This question is centered around how to write <code>generateSha :: FileInfo -&gt; String</code>.</p>

<p>I see a few functions that are likely to be helpful:</p>

<pre><code>fileSource :: MonadResource m =&gt; FileInfo -&gt; Source m ByteString
sha256Incremental :: Decoder SHA256State
completeSha256Incremental :: Decoder SHA256State -&gt; Int -&gt; Digest SHA256State
showDigest :: Digest t-&gt; String
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm unsure of a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to wire this up in the conduit. Ideally I'd have it stream the file.</li>
<li>Use the SHA interface to incrementally build up the hash. I can get the SHA256 of an empty string easily enough, but I'm not sure how to  add values.  Presumably it's something hidden in the Decoder type?</li>
<li>What the <code>Int</code> argument of completeSha256Incremental is.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can somebody point me in the right direction?</p>
","<p>This is only a partial answer.  I am stuck in cabal hell right now and can't install <code>sha-streams</code> to see if things work right.</p>

<p>Calculating a SHA256 incrementally is done like this:</p>

<pre><code>sha256FromChunks :: [ByteString] -&gt; Digest SHA256State
sha256FromChunks cs = completeSHA256Incremental $
                          foldl pushChunk sha256Incremental cs
</code></pre>

<p><code>pushChunk</code> is from <code>Data.Binary.Get</code>.  That shows you how all the function calls fit together, but isn't very practical for a streaming scenario.</p>

<p>To use this with conduit, you would need to turn it into a <code>Sink</code>.</p>

<p>we need the git pull to always run. But if package.json doesn't change, we don't need to re-install. </p>

<p>I have two questions - how can we get the git pull to always run? I believe we can cache bust using a <code>--build-arg</code></p>

<p>However, if git pull always runs, then according to docker, so will the <code>npm install</code> command.</p>

<p>One thing we could do is use some custom logic to compare the sha-sum of the package.json files.</p>

<pre><code>RUN git clone &lt;url&gt;
RUN git pull
ENV package_shasum $(sha1sum package.json)
RUN compare-shasums &amp;&amp; npm install
</code></pre>

<p>does anybody know how to do this with Docker?
The reason why we are doing the git stuff in Docker instead of outside the container and copying files into the container is for making Jenkins easier to work with.</p>
","<p>Normally if we COPY code from the host to image, we can use this trick to cache dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
</code></pre>

<p>and that will only run <code>npm install</code> if the package.json file has changed.
But if we do the git pull in the Dockerfile, then it's a bit different, but we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>RUN git clone git@github.com:ORESoftware/live-mutex.git
ADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ORESoftware/live-mutex/master/package.json package.json
RUN npm install
RUN git fetch origin/master
RUN git checkout master

","<p>MD5 has known vulnerabilities at this point, but that may not be a problem for your application. It's still reasonably good for distinguishing piles of bits. If something comes up with no match, then you know you haven't already seen it, since the algorithm is deterministic. If something comes back as a match, you should actually compare it to the blob that it ostensibly matched before acting as if it's really a duplicate. MD5 is relatively fast, but if you can't afford full-text comparisons on hash collisions, you should probably use a stronger hash, like SHA-256.</p>

","<p>We use MD5 at my work for exactly what you're considering.  Works great.  We only need to detect duplicates uploads on a per-customer basis, which reduces our exposure to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">birthday problem</a>, but md5 would still be sufficient for us if we had to detect duplicates across all uploads rather than per customer.  If you can believe the internet, the probability p of a collision given n samples and a hash size of b is bounded by:</p>

<pre><code>p &lt;= n (n - 1) / (2 * 2 ^ b)

<p>A few years back I ran this calculation for n = 10^9 and b = 128 and came up with p &lt;= 1.469E-21.  To put that in perspective, 10^9 files is one per second for 32 years.  So we don't compare files in the event of a collision.  If md5 says the uploads were the same, they're the same.</p>

<p><strong>App.pm</strong></p>

<p>Below is what I'm doing in the App.pm. You can see that I'm just trying to require a login for the home page. Maybe I need some '/login' code?</p>

<pre><code>package glm::App;

use Dancer2;
use Dancer2::Plugin::Database;
use Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible;
use Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase;

use Template;

our $VERSION = '0.1';

    my $sth = database-&gt;prepare('SELECT name FROM product', { RaiseError =&gt; 1 });
    $sth-&gt;execute();

    template 'create_list', {
        'products' =&gt; $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref('name'),
    };
};

get '/generate'=&gt; sub {
    my $phrase = passphrase('my_password')-&gt;generate({ algorithm =&gt; 'SHA-1' });
    return $phrase-&gt;rfc2307(); # right now I just manually copy and paste this into the database
};
</code></pre>

<p>My database follows the <a href=""https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database#SUGGESTED-SCHEMA"" rel=""nofollow"">suggested schema</a> for users, passwords, and roles.</p>

<p>Maybe the only other relevant bit of information I can think of is that if I use an encryption scheme not recognized by Digest, I get an error from Digest.pm. That would seem to indicate that it's recognizing the hashed password and trying to decrypt it, but for whatever reason it's just not working. Or it's working and redirecting back to the home page... But why doesn't it do that with 'test,test'?</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> You're using two different methods for hashing, so the generated hashes are incompatible.</p>

<p><a href=""https://metacpan.org/source/Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Base#L99"" rel=""nofollow"">Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database</a> uses Crypt::SaltedHash:</p>

<pre><code>sub encrypt_password {
    my ($self, $password, $algorithm) = @_;
    $algorithm ||= 'SHA-1';
    my $crypt = Crypt::SaltedHash-&gt;new(algorithm =&gt; $algorithm);
    $crypt-&gt;add($password);
    $crypt-&gt;generate;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a hash like:</p>

<pre><code>{SSHA}qTEaPf8KRPt6XBQXIlQhlWstgBz64coW
</code></pre>

<p>Compare that to what you got from Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase:</p>

<pre><code>{SSHA}+2Dro1/ntPchT93mgvYMKGjdzy+XKXK1agsG3//hKuLNrQAK
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the lengths are different. Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase uses a 16-byte salt by default, while Crypt::SaltedHash uses a 4-byte salt.</p>

<hr>

<p>Although you <em>could</em> tell Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase to use a 4-byte salt, it's much easier to just use Crypt::SaltedHash everywhere. The Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible <a href=""https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible#DESCRIPTION"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> explains how to do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A simple script called <code>generate-crypted-password</code> to generate RFC2307-style hashed passwords is included, or you can use Crypt::SaltedHash yourself to do so, or use the <code>slappasswd</code> utility if you have it installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ generate-crypted-password 
Enter plain-text password ?&gt; foo

  and when x is 1, y is chosen</p>

<p>This is a critical sentence for me.
I wanted to know how the desiner find second form ch function.</p>

<p>but I guess, if I obtain the view of your advise then, that is obvious.</p>

<p>if a designer of sha256 want to use ch function like it, that makes sense.when x is zero, y is 0, and z is left, because x and z is connected with xor gate,and x and y is connected with and gate.when x is one, y is y and z is nothing, because there are two z connected with xor gate;</p>

<p>I should start my guess from the perspective of the one who structured SHA256 algorythm.</p>

<p>Thanks for teaching!!</p>

","<p>If you write out the truth table for x, y, z and the 2 expressions, you will see that they are <strong>identical</strong>.</p>

<p>the result is <code>False</code>, therefore, incorrect!</p>
","<p>Don't know why you'd do this, but here's a solution for you.</p>

<p>Here's some assumptions.</p>

<ol>
<li>You were given two date hashes (two inputs)</li>
<li>You know exactly how the date hashes were created (EG: always in the format of YYYY-MM-DD)</li>
<li>You know the range of your target date (So you can reverse the hash back to the original date)</li>
</ol>

<p>So in psudocode, you'd do something like this.</p>

<pre><code>date getDateFromHash(string inputHash) {
  date startDate = '1911-01-01';
  date endDate = '2017-12-31';
  for(date checkDate = startDate; checkDate &lt; endDate; checkDate + 1 day) {
    if (sha1(checkDate) = inputHash) { return checkDate }
  }
  return null;
}
date firstDate = getDateFromHash(""0b10f03fb245a6486d6ab5b25a2f050bf87093a5""); // 2017-09-07
date secondDate = getDateFromHash(""34152f3661d73490ac89b0fe15cb3170aac06bb8""); // 2017-09-06
if (firstDate &gt; secondDate) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
} // compare using default date operators
</code></pre>

<p>But honestly speaking, like the comment says, there's no point of hashing date values. Hence why I'm only dropping a quich psudo code for you just to point you in the right direction, if you seriously want to tread down this path.</p>

","<p><strong>The point of salt is to add entropy to the hash.</strong>
Cryptographic hashes are designed so that a tiny change to the input makes a huge difference in the resulting hash, so (barring a flaw in the algorithm) it becomes impossible to know whether the original input was the same from checking the similarity between two differently salted hashes.</p>

<p>But if you use the same salt for everyone, you lose much of the benefit that provides.  <strong>Two identical passwords hashed with the same salt will give you the same hash.</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you use the same salt for everyone, then at the very least, someone can figure out that two users have the same password.  </p></li>
<li><p>More importantly, it greatly lessens the time someone has to spend to crack passwords, since they can now check the same hash against every user at once.</p></li>
<li><p>At worst, someone could already have a lookup table for the salt you use, making it trivial to crack every user's password.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>While it's possible to use a simple salt (like the user's ID) to achieve the goal of making cracking harder, <strong>it's only a tiny bit more effort to use a random string,</strong> and makes cracking even harder (since the salt is nearly impossible to predict ahead of time, the chance of having a precomputed lookup table for that salt becomes much lower).</p>

","<p>The reason you're getting different results is because the Ruby code converts <code>'testing'</code> into UTF-16, and the jsSHA example is using ASCII. If you expand ""testing"" into 16-bit Unicode, you get <code>""740065007300740069006e006700""</code> in hexadecimal, which gives the same answer as Ruby.

<li>All the files in the Repository</li>

<p>2.I am having Windows machine. I have installed Sourcetree(GitClient) alone, not git software. And I created a repo at Github.com(remote repository), and by these, I am achieving my workspace as versioning process. My workspace is at remote.</p>

<p><strong>Please correct my thought if I am wrong</strong> -> ""Without Installing Git server in our machine, we can achieve code versioning via Remote repository. And, if we need Local Repository, we should need Git server."" </p>

<p>Please, someone, clarify my doubt's. Thank you :)</p>
","<h2>SHA calculation</h2>

<p>The SHA is a result of the parent object(s) hashes, the tree hash, the name and email of the author, the timestamp, the commit message text, and the files involved in the commit. (And the GPG signature, if one is present.)</p>

<p>That is why if you change the commit message, or rebase a commit, you end up with a new SHA.</p>

<p>The rest of the files in the repository are not directly involved in that SHA, but the SHA of the parent(s) of the commit are part of the calculation, so they are indirectly involved.</p>

<p>You can see the metadata involved by using <code>cat-file</code>. Take a commit ID and do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p 3d911c37dc7cc6d50af9cbc66aa36084158308f5
tree 487660899e53bef8b15d3e1692172f689ed965c5

committer Dan Lowe &lt;dan@xxxxxx.com&gt; 1483760015 -0500

</code></pre>

<p>Here we see the tree object, one parent, author &amp; committer, and the commit message text. Not shown are the file objects attached, but they are there. In some cases a second parent is also present (e.g. a merge commit).</p>

<h2>Git clients and servers</h2>

<p>All git repositories are full repositories (except shallow clones). So if you make a new repository on your laptop, it is a full repository. You can add, remove, commit, rebase, all of those operations are completely local. The entire repository history is on your laptop. That is one reason git is so good at working offline.</p>

<p>However, most people that is not enough. They need to share code with other developers, or publish it for public consumption. This is the purpose of services like Github, Bitbucket, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Those services are just another copy of the full repository, and you are synchronizing with it.</strong></p>

<p>Here's something you can try. I'll use command line git instead of SourceTree.</p>

<pre><code>## Make two repositories
mkdir a &amp;&amp; cd a &amp;&amp; git init
cd ..
mkdir b &amp;&amp; cd b &amp;&amp; git init --bare

## Add some content to 'a'
cd ../a
touch a.txt &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m ""New content""

## Set the other repository as your remote
git remote add origin ../b

## Let's push!
git push -u origin master

## Take a look at 'b' now...
cd ../b
git log
</code></pre>

<p>... and your commit from a is there. You just made a git server! Although not the most useful one really, because it's just on your disk. But if you put some SSH or https server in the middle... now you have Github, just without the fancy web interface part.</p>

","<p>This is according to my knowledge</p>

<p>Sha1
Some collision attacks against Sha1 exist but are not currently practical as the CPU power required is estimated as costing almost $3 million for each hash.</p>

<p>Even if Sha1 can be considered acceptable for most uses, Sha2 is all-around a better alternative: it is just as fast, more secure, and the only potential downside is the larger space required for storing the hash. If for some reason this is a concern (we’re talking about 32 bytes instead of 20) truncating Sha2′s output is still more secure than using Sha1.</p>

<p>The only reason Sha1 should be chosen is for interoperability reasons.</p>

<p>Sha2
Sha2 is the successor of Sha1 and has 4 different variants, each with a different digest size (output size):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sha-256 should be chosen in most cases where a high speed hash
  function is desired. It is considered secure with no known theoretical
  vulnerabilities and it has a reasonable digest size of 32 bytes. For
  things like hashing user password, though, a function designed to be
  slow is preferred: a great one is bcrypt.</p>
  
  <p>Sha-224 uses the same algorithm as Sha-256 (except for the initial
  seed values) simply truncating its output. It was created because its
  digest size has the same length as two-key Triple DES keys which can
  be handy.</p>
  
  <p>Sha-512 is different, using 64 bit numbers and having 80 rounds
  (versus 32 bit numbers and 64 rounds of Sha-256). Its digest size – 64
  bytes – is very large and it is probably overkill for most uses.</p>
  
  <p>Sha-384 is the same as Sha-512 (again, except for the initial seed
  values) but truncated to reduce its digest size.</p>

<p>I do have a way to verify users with their emails, I just need a way to take the passwords they give me and save them into the database in a Django-acceptable way.  It will be have to be done in Perl since that's the only language I know on the server.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.bloggerpolis.com/2011/09/how-to-generate-a-django-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> talking about how Django handles passwords, but I sadly don't understand most of what they're saying.  Also, I don't know if it's any help, but the admin area of the Django site gives the ""hint"" of  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Use '[algo]$[salt]$[hexdigest]'"" for the password.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn't mean much to me either, but maybe it does to one of you?</p>
","<p>There are basically two ways to handle this: convert existing passwords to a format acceptable by Django, or write your own Django password hasher.</p>

<p>For the first way, as you found, the password field consists of three parts, each separated by a <code>$</code>. (Django 1.6 passwords <em>may</em> have 4 parts, but let's ignore that extra part for now, since Django 1.6 also supports the more traditional 3-part passwords.) The parts are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>algorithm,</strong> which describes the password hashing algorithm; it will look like <em>md5</em>, <em>pbkdf2</em>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>salt,</strong> the salt for the hash algorithm</li>
<li><strong>hexdigest,</strong> the hashed password</li>
</ul>

<p>So, assuming your passwords are already salted and hashed, your script needs to take the hashed/salted passwords in your existing database, separate the salt from the hash, then store them into the database with the appropriate algorithm string prefixed. There should be Perl modules for doing password hashing using various algorithms. Django's recommended algorithm is PBKDF2. bcrypt is also good. Any hash algorithm is fine, though, as far as Django is concerned, as long as it has a built-in hasher for that algorithm (Django has hashers for the most common hashing algorithms).</p>

<p>If your existing passwords are not salted and hashed…well, now would be a good time to do that. ;-)</p>

<hr>

<p>The alternative way is to just copy the passwords over to the new database as-is, and write your own <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/passwords/"" rel=""nofollow"">password hasher</a> to handle them in your Django app. Of course, that would require writing some Python code.</p>

<p>If md5 ssl became vulnerable why there is still Thawte certificate signed by md5 in browsers?</p>

<p>And also, how does ssl collision finding algorythm works? Is it the same as finding md5/sha hash collision, or it's just a part of it? I am confused because of two files: key and cert.</p>

<p>My thoughts:
We are creating key file with text ""a"", then sign certificate with this key and check md5 sum if it equals needed md5 sum. Then change ""a"" to ""b"". But it seems to be bruteforce, not collision finding. Is it correct?</p>

","<p>First of all, your code is bad. It lacks two braces and the function <code>SHA1.context</code> doesn't exist in this library (it should be <code>SHA1.reset</code>, I think). Moreover, <code>Message_Digest</code> and <code>context</code> aren't declared. Please provide the full code you actually use.</p>

<p>However, I see you have at least two serious bugs.</p>

<p>Firstly, you pass the value of <code>x</code> to <code>SHA1.update</code>, but you should pass a pointer to the message. Therefore, the function processes a message that lies at the address <code>123</code> in the memory (you should get a compiler warning about this). If you want to calculate a hash from the value of <code>x</code>, try this:</p>

<pre><code>call SHA1.update(context, &amp;x, sizeof(x));
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, <code>Message_Digest</code> seems to be a <code>uint8_t</code> array of size <code>SHA1HashSize</code>. In the last statement you print a pointer to this array instead of its content (and again, the compiler should warn you), so you get an adress of this array in the memory. You may want to process the array in a loop:</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t i;
for(i = 0; i &lt; SHA1HashSize; ++i) {
    // process Message_Digest[i], for instance print it
}

","<p>Using the account ID as a salt is probably not a good idea - if someone can steal your hashed passwords, then they can probably get the account ID's too.  Having a more convoluted hash in code in this instance is therefore probably more secure, provided that the code is also well protected.  Using a known random string as the salt in the code means that someone would have to hack both your data and your code in order to attack passwords - that has to be better than just having to attack the database alone.</p>

","<p>I would do this by assembling an <code>uint16_t</code> from two <code>char</code>s using explicit shifts and ORs:</p>

<pre><code>uint16_t x = (((uint16_t)(uint8_t)temp[1]) &lt;&lt; 8) |
             (((uint18_t)(uint8_t)temp[0]) &lt;&lt; 0);
</code></pre>

<p>The double casts are necessary to ensure that each <code>char</code> value is zero- rather than sign-extended to the width of <code>uint16_t</code>, before the shift.  Note also that I am reading from <code>temp</code>, not <code>buf</code> - the <em>raw</em> SHA hash, not the hex-coded hash.  Using the hex-coded hash would limit the possible values that <code>x</code> could take.</p>

<p>Then, convert <code>x</code> to a floating-point number in the range <code>[0, 1)</code> by dividing it by 65536:</p>

<pre><code>double f = x / 65536.0;
</code></pre>

<p>65536 is 2<sup>16</sup>; the value range of <code>uint16_t</code> is 0 through 65535, inclusive. The <code>.0</code> suffix on the divisor is necessary to make C perform floating-point rather than integer division.  For efficiency, this division can be combined with the next step of multiplying by 2&pi;:</p>

<pre><code>double f = x * (2 * M_PI / 65536);
</code></pre>

<p><code>M_PI</code> (declared in <code>math.h</code>) is already a floating-point number, so we no longer need a <code>.0</code> suffix on 65536, but you need to put parentheses around the entire subexpression <code>2 * M_PI / 65536</code> to force the compiler to evaluate that part at compile-time and emit just one runtime multiplication.</p>

","<p>Let's take a closer look at that algorithm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Run the input through SHA-1 (RFC 3174 [4]).</li>
  <li>Treat the output as little endian and extract the last-significant 16 bits. (These are the first two bytes of the output, with the second
  byte being the most significant one.)</li>
  <li>Divide the value by 65536 (use float division) and multiply it by 2π (two Pi).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The algorithm isn't saying to treat the first two bytes as a floating point value.  It says to treat them as a 16-bit integer, then convert the value to a floating point type for the next step.</p>

<p>Also, you should be using <code>temp</code> instead of <code>buf</code> when converting the values, as <code>buf</code> contains printable characters representing hash output while <code>temp</code> contains the actual output.</p>

<p>So you would convert the value like this:</p>

<pre><code>uint16_t value;
value = temp[0];
value |= temp[1] &lt;&lt; 8;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you cast it to <code>double</code> for the next step:</p>

<pre><code>double result = value * 2 * M_PI / 65536;

I swear some of them wound up in later versions of the Studio compiler suite (since we were sub-contracted by Sun itself, that's not surprising, nevermind the fact that some of them were blatantly obvious - <code>floor()</code> and <code>ceil()</code>, IIRC, were two of them - and should have been there in the first place...)</p>

<p><strong>Isn't the overall result must be the same?
or changing order result in diffrent hash</strong> </p>
","<p>It's actually a good thing if changing the order of input changes the hash value. Otherwise you'd run into issues where ""bat"" and ""tab"" both hashed to the same value, for example. For cryptographic hashes like SHA-256, the goal is to make it impossible (with a very large but not infinite amount of resources) to find any other input that produces the same hash value, and ""bat"" and ""tab"" are two different inputs, so it would be both surprising and unfortunate if they had the same hash value.</p>

<p>This does not look right. If you have just one string, the declaration should be:</p>

md.update(UPDATES.getBytes());

<p>If you have multiple strings to digest:</p>

<pre><code>MessageDigest          md = MessageDigest.getInstance(ALGORITHM) ;
String                 str[] = {""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D""} ;

for (String s : str)

","<p><code>header_hex</code> is a regular string of lower case ASCII characters and the <code>decode()</code> method with <code>'hex'</code> argument changes it to a (binary) string (or <code>bytes</code> object in Python 3) with bytes <code>0x93 0xa0</code> etc. In C it would be an array of unsigned char of length 64 in this case.</p>

<p>This array/byte string of length 64 is then hashed with SHA256 and its result (another binary string of size 32) is again hashed. So <code>hash</code> is a string of length 32, or a bytes object of that length in Python 3. Then <code>encode('hex_codec')</code> is a synomym for <code>encode('hex')</code> (in Python 2); in Python 3, it replaces it (so maybe this code is meant to work in both versions). It outputs an ASCII (lower hex) string again that replaces each raw byte (which is just a small integer) with a two character string that is its hexadecimal representation. So the final bit reverses the double hash and outputs it as hexadecimal, to a form which I usually call ""lowercase hex ASCII"".  </p>

","<p>Your hash is placed at the most significant end of the value, as RSA uses big endian encoding. This means that the value may be returned mod N (the modulus), which will result in a different value than that you put in.</p>

<p>Place the hash at the least significant end of the message and your code should run.</p>

<p>It appears that the Sha for the HASH is identical but the second Sha (digest) gives a differing result in the NodeJs version. Any pointers to where I'm going wrong? </p>

<p>For reference I'm using sha library in python and crypto in NodeJs</p>
","<p>One problem is that you're implicitly converting the <code>HASH</code> Buffer to a UTF-8 string which is liable to cause corrupt output when converting binary to UTF-8. Instead, you can call <code>.update()</code> multiple times and preserve the binary data in <code>HASH</code>:</p>

<pre><code>digestHash.update(nonce + createdDate);
digestHash.update(HASH);
var digest = digestHash.digest();
</code></pre>

<p>On an unrelated note, you don't need <code>base64_encode_string()</code> for Buffers, as for those you can simply do <code>buffer.toString('base64')</code> (e.g. <code>HASH.toString('base64')</code>).</p>

The user enters their username and password and I store the encrypted password with SHA-512 in a file. Then I prompt the user to ""log in"" and i need to validate that the password they input this time is the password they entered when they ""signed up"". The problem arises in the validation part. When i store the password, I store the salt along with it in the file. But because the salt is a <code>byte[]</code> array, it shows the same <code>[B@232204a1</code> when i convert it to a string and store it in the file.</p>

<p>Through <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28192265/java-generating-a-random-salt-isnt-random"">this answer</a> what i did was that i stored the salt byte array values in a string by concatenating them together so it'd be a continuous value and easier to read during validation.</p>

<p>In the validation part, i read the stored salt correctly, but when i use <code>.getBytes()</code> and then use the same code from the link above, it ouputs a different value than the one i had stored. And hence when i use it to calculate the hashed password, it obviously gives me the wrong answer.</p>

"41468604","git rebase and SHAs mentioned in log messages","<p>Sometimes the log message for a git commit will mention the SHA of other commits.  This happens in the suggested log message for <code>git revert</code> and you also may add it by hand ('fixed bug introduced in abcd0123').</p>

<p>When rebasing, the SHAs of commits change.  Is there a way I can automatically fix up the log messages to have the new SHAs?  In general, this might not be possible in 100% of cases (a commit might disappear altogether, be squashed, etc).  But 90% of the time a simple rebase leaves a one-to-one correspondence between the original and the rebased commits, so it should be possible to remap the SHAs in log messages.</p>

<p>I have tried <code>git rebase --verbose</code>, which I hoped would print something like</p>

<pre><code>Applying: My log message here.
  old commit was 01234
  new commit is abcde
</code></pre>

<p>I could then use that to manually fiddle the log messages (with a further rebase... which would in turn change the SHAs... so it would be awkward, but nonetheless possible).  But as far as I can tell <code>--verbose</code> doesn't print more information than the normal mode.</p>

<p>Is there some magic tool which will rebase and rewrite the log messages for me?  In the absence of ponies, can I convince <code>git rebase</code> to print more information about old and new SHAs so I can do the job myself?</p>

<p>You can use <code>git patch-id</code> to find commits that apply the same changes, the most brute-force method would be</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list --no-merges --reflog --all \

<p>What I am wanting to do is to rename the <strong>Sha256.print</strong> to <strong>Sha256.Msg</strong>. I have tried to rename the <strong>class Sha256Class : public Print</strong> to <strong>class Sha256Class : public Msg</strong> but that did not work.

","<p>You should simply just have to change the name of the prototype in the header file, then change the name of the definition of the implementation in the cpp file, and finally remember to change the name where you are using it. </p>

<p>.h:</p>

<pre><code>size_t print(const char* str); to size_t Msg(const char * str)
</code></pre>

<p>.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>size_t Sha256Class::print(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}

to

size_t Sha256Class::Msg(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>arduino file:</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t* hash;
uint32_t a;
unsigned long ms;
Serial.println(""Test: RFC4231 4.2"");
Serial.println(""Expect:b0344c61d8db38535ca8afceaf0bf12b881dc200c9833da726e9376c2e32cff7"");
Serial.print(""Result:"");
ms = micros();
Sha256.initHmac(hmacKey1,20);
/* change from Sha256.print(""Hi There"") to */
Sha256.Msg(""Hi There"");
printHash(Sha256.resultHmac());
Serial.print("" Hash took : "");
Serial.print((micros() - ms));
Serial.println("" micros"");
Serial.println();
</code></pre>

<p>However, since you have a <code>#if  defined(SHA256_LINUX)</code> around the prototype in the header file it could possibly not be declared as <code>Msg(const char *str)</code> instead of <code>print(const char *str)</code> so the best solution would just be to leave the print function implemented and create a second method that does the same thing.</p>

<p>In response to the comment.</p>

<p>.h:</p>

<pre><code>// Add this somewhere in the code wherever you see fit
size_t Msg(const char * str);
</code></pre>

<p>.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>//Add this somewhere in the cide wherever you see fit
size_t Sha256Class::Msg(const char *str){
    return write_L(str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in the arduino file just call the function as you wanted it to be with the new name <code>Sha256.Msg(""Hi There"");</code></p>

<p>But you can still use it.  When a user submits a password, perform ""SHA256"" on the user's submitted password, and compare it with the stored, hashed password.  By the looks of the string above, you may need to convert the hash output to a hex string to compare it.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may first need to find out if a salt is applied to the hash (additional random content added on a per-user basis to increase security).  If so, then you'll need to apply the salt to the user's submitted password before hashing it.</p>

","<p>Your function looks fine and should output a correct salted SHA-1 hash.</p>

<p>However, the storage scheme prefix in your LDIF file should be {SSHA} (for salted SHA1) instead of {SHA} - or you did not intend to use salt (?).</p>

<p>Also, the actual output of a hash algorithm is binary data which can be represented in hexadecimal or base64 strings. LDAP storage schemes use base64 encoding.</p>

<p><strong>What can you do ?</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In your LDIF we can recognize hex strings, so the first thing is to make that hash encoded in base64 instead of hexadecimal, depending on imported base64 package : </p>

<pre><code>// Using org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64 
generatedPassword = Base64.encodeBase64String(bytes);

// Using java.util.Base64 
generatedPassword = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(bytes);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you don't want to salt, you need to comment out the following line (with an empty salt string it is still ""salt"" and won't yield the same output as no salting) : </p>

<pre><code>md.update(salt.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set the proper storage scheme prefix according to the point above. For example, using SHA-1 with salt, the password attribute value in ldif should look like this :</p>

<pre><code>userPassword: {SSHA}&lt;base64_encoded_hash&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few other things to consider :</strong></p>

<ul>

Specifically, that their API services will use EnTrust’s SHA-256, 2048-bit certificate. </p>

<p>It goes on: ""Please contact your solution provider and web hosting company to ensure your solution has these certificates installed and is capable of using them to secure your connection to Authorize.Net. ""</p>

<p>When users connect to the payment pages on my site, they are on a secure connection (DigiCert SHA-256 certificate), but I'm not sure if that means that my site's connection to api.authorize.net is similarly secured. </p>

<p>Sorry for asking what is probably a very dumb question, but how can I find out if this change will require any re-coding on my end, and how can I check that my site's certificate is going to work? </p>

<p>Thanks so much for your help!</p>
","<p>I also got the notice from authorize.net, but fortunately for me our hosting site's admins took care of it.  I got a similar notice from PayPal, which is also upgrading their certificates for SHA-256 compliance. In researching that one I came across this related Stack Overflow question: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32609093/how-can-i-tell-if-my-paypal-certificate-is-sha-256-paypal-service-upgrades"">How can I tell if my paypal certificate is SHA-256? - PayPal service upgrades</a>. </p>

<p>One answer links to this <a href=""https://gist.github.com/robglas/3ef9582c6292470a1743"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">github gist</a> which uses openssl and awk to check the installed certs. If you run it and see the certs that authorize.net has upgraded too listed, that should tell you your server will work.  This is a assuming you're on a Linux server.

","<p>At first glance you've done all the heavy lifting, that screenshot looks a lot like its going to be the LE endian swapper section. I'm assuming you're spot on here. I expect that v17 is the mask variable - it's loaded as vs49 from the TOC earlier on.</p>

<p>The key piece of information you're missing is that v0 is vs32 (endlessly confusing I know). I'm not sure where the best place to demonstrate this is but the ABI will do.

"31122760","Method for storing users passwords for other services","<p>I run a service that integrates with a few other cloud platforms via their apis.  In order to do this, we have to store the login credentials for OTHER sites in our database. Obviously security is a bit of a risk here.</p>

<p>So far, we have been storing the passwords using AES encryption and a salted version of the user's password(for our site) as the cipher.  When a user requests something from the api, they must input their password.  The password checked for validity against the sha hash that we store, and once confirmed, is used to decrypt the password.</p>

<p>The problem is, we would like to start offering a service that retrieves data from the apis we interact with at scheduled intervals(outside the scope of synchronous user requests.).  If we do this, our current security structure will no longer be viable.</p>

<p>My question is, are there any ways to allow for this type of api interaction without storing recoverable versions the passwords in our database?  If not, what are my options for securely storing passwords?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I'm creating once and again the document, with the same process, same data and same filename (once I check the signature I write it down and delete the file to try with the other browser). </p>

<p>I suspect that browsers' PDF plugins are adding some type of comment inside the stream, invisible to the user, that makes each file different from the other (and from the original FileStreamResult whose signature I stored on DB).</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone know other causes than could be causing this result and if there is any way to get the correct signature on my database.</p>

<p>Any insight on this matter will be much appreciated.</p>

"30429087","Port PHP SHA1 Encrypted Password database to NODE application?","<p>A customer of mine is using Open Cart as an eCommerce platform. They are moving to a custom node-based system and the question has been asked can we port the customers and their logins including sha1 encrypted password which also uses an MD5 salt.</p>

<p>Here is the query that saves the password: 
<code>
$this-&gt;db-&gt;query(""UPDATE "" . DB_PREFIX . ""customer SET salt = '"" . $this-&gt;db-&gt;escape($salt = substr(md5(uniqid(rand(), true)), 0, 9)) . ""', password = '"" . $this-&gt;db-&gt;escape(sha1($salt . sha1($salt . sha1($password)))) . ""' WHERE LOWER(email) = '"" . $this-&gt;db-&gt;escape(utf8_strtolower($email)) . ""'"");
</code> </p>

<p>So if i retrieve the salt for each customer by email address and encrypt the input password with sha1 using the same salt, would I in fact be able to match the input password with the one previously encrypted in PHP and stored in mysql? </p>

</code></pre>

<p>How is that. If there is an implementation of SHA256 in my netbsd openssh, why isn't it available as a mac cipher?</p>
","<p>OpenSSH 5.0 had support for SHA-256 key exchange algorithm, but not for MACs with SHA-256 hashes. For the reference, there is a source code:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/V_5_0_P1/myproposal.h"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/V_5_0_P1/myproposal.h</a></p>

<p>The SHA256 usage in <strong>MAC</strong> and in <strong>Key exchange</strong> is totally distinct and one does not affect the other. If SHA256 is used in either of them depends on the availability of this hash in underlying OpenSSL, but also if the OpenSSH implemented such algorithm. 10 years ago (2007), it was implemented only as a key exchange algorithm (the MAC were standardized later).</p>

<p>The original <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC4253</a> does not list any SHA256 algorithms. The DH key exchange method was standardized in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4419"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC4419</a> (2006), but the HMACS using SHA2 were standardized as late as in 2012 in <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6668"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC6668</a>.</p>

<p>Your version is between them, where there was no standard for this so it was not implemented.</p>

"46856459","How can I create a commit with a new SHA in git?","<p>I need to create an equivalent commit object with a different SHA in Git. All commits are GPG signed. I know that I can change author + commit timestamps, but the resolution is only a second, and we are not permitted to deviate from the system clock by more than a second. I also cannot change commit messages, author / commiter names and emails and / or the key used to sign the commit. Which other fields of the commit can I change in order to get a different commit message?</p>

<hr>

<p>Motivation: We are using an internal tool which for some reason does not work if two properties reference the same commit, even though we are setting it intentionally.</p>
","<p>The technical answer to the question is this:</p>

<p>The hashed data includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a header you don't control (and that is, in any case, derived from the other data I'm about to mention)</li>
<li>the commit's <code>TREE</code> object hash - a reflection of the commit content</li>
<li>the parent <code>COMMIT</code> object(s) hash(es)</li>
<li>Author name,email,timestamp</li>
<li>Committer name,email,timestamp</li>
<li>Commit message</li>
</ul>

<p>Varying the <code>TREE</code> may stretch the definition of ""equivalent"" commit.  You've explicitly ruled out changing the commit message or author / committer info.  The remaining option is the commit parent list, but whether that makes any sense to talk about depends on what it is you're doing.</p>

<p>So since options are limited, let's take a quick look at each of these (even the ones that seem to be excluded):</p>

<p><strong><code>TREE</code> object</strong>: This uniquely represents the content - i.e. what data you would see in what files at what paths in the working tree.  At a glance, this seems like the thing that must be unchanged to meet the most basic definition of ""equivalent commit"".  Of course, any change - no matter how small, no matter where in the work tree - would change the hash, so maybe you could wedge in a file or directory specifically for nonce values to vary the hash?</p>

<p><strong>Author or committer Info</strong>: First thing to think about: How sensitive is the requirement not to touch names?  Could you stick an invisible character at the end of the name and be ok, or do they have to match bit-for-bit?</p>

<p>Alternately, those time stamps... Saying you can't vary from the system clock, when the commit timestamp is defined to refer to commit creation time anyway, seems pedantic unless you're trying to create several equivalent commits all at once.  Even if you need two at the same time, you should be able to do that without exceeding your tolerance.</p>

<p><strong>Commit Message</strong>: Again, how strict is the requirement not to change this?  Could you get by with a newline, or at least an invisible character?</p>

<p><strong>Parent Commit</strong>: If you're still at brick walls with all of the above, then here's what's left.  And this really boils down to, what are the commits <em>for</em>?  Is the duplicate commit going to have the same parent?</p>

<pre><code>P -- A
 \
  A'
</code></pre>

<p>In that case you can't really do anything here.  But alternately, if it's parallel trees of commits:</p>

<pre><code>P -- A

P' -- A'
</code></pre>

<p>Well, then all you need to do is seed each tree with a root commit that differs in some way.  Commit messages like ""Root commit 1"", ""Root commit 2"", ..., for example?</p>

<p>On Ubuntu, my shell is running ""en_US.UTF-8"".</p>

<p>I've run into the case where the signature is different on different systems: AIX, Windows w/Ubuntu, Windows w/Powershell, etc. I'm trying to figure out why.</p>
","<p>There are at least three problems here: Powershell pipelines aren't binary-safe, you have the wrong variable name, and <code>echo</code> isn't portable/reliable.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At least according to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24708859/output-binary-data-on-powershell-pipeline"">this question</a>, you can't pipe binary data in Powershell. The output of <code>openssl</code> (which is raw binary data) is getting treated as UTF-8 text (presumably due to <code>$OutputEncoding</code>), and mangled in the process. You can tell by decoding from base64 and looking in hex instead:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo '77u/W8O5RwJeBsOodDddXeKUlCQD4pSUduKVrD3ilIxADQo=' | base64 -D | xxd
00000000: efbb bf5b c3b9 4702 5e06 c3a8 7437 5d5d  ...[..G.^...t7]]
00000010: e294 9424 03e2 9494 76e2 95ac 3de2 948c  ...$....v...=...
00000020: 400d 0a                                  @..
</code></pre>

<p>It starts with <code>EF BB BF</code>, which is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UTF-8 byte order mark</a>; and it ends with <code>0D 0A</code>, which is a DOS/Windows line ending (ASCII carriage return and linefeed characters). Something else bad is happening as well, since it's much too long for a sha1 hash, even if you account for the BOM and line ending.</p>

<p>The output of <code>echo</code> is probably getting mangled similarly, so even if the hash wasn't mangled it'd be the hash of the wrong byte sequence.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42150420/why-does-encrypting-hmac-sha1-in-exactly-the-same-code-in-c-sharp-and-powershell"">this question (and its answer)</a> for an example of using Powershell's  own tools to compute the HMAC-SHA1 of a string.</p></li>
<li><p>The message to be signed is in <code>$message</code>, but you actually sign <code>$string_to_sign</code>, which is undefined. The Ubuntu result is the correct HMAC-SHA1 for the null string:</p>

<pre><code>$ &lt;/dev/null openssl sha1 -hmac ""706Fdj+LFKf8pf/2Wh5V8Q8jbgGUUQo3xSXr5sbt"" -binary | openssl base64
NCRRWG4nL9sN8QMrdmCPmUvNlYA=
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>As Lorinczy Zsigmond pointed out, <code>echo -en</code> isn't predictable. Under some implementations/OSes/shells/compile &amp; runtime options/phases of moon/etc, it might or might not print ""-en"" as part of its output, and maybe also print a newline (or something) at the end. Use <code>printf</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>printf 'GET\n\n\n%s\n/%s%s' ""${now}"" ""${bucket}"" ""${path}"" | openssl sha1 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Or (in bash, but not all other shells):</p>

<pre><code>printf -v message 'GET\n\n\n%s\n/%s%s' ""${now}"" ""${bucket}"" ""${path}""
printf '%s' ""$message"" | openssl sha1 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Or (bash again):</p>

<pre><code>nl=$'\n'
message=""GET${nl}${nl}${nl}${now}${nl}/${bucket}${path}""
printf '%s' ""$message"" | openssl sha1 ...

<p>More specifically is there such an algorithm supported out of the box by NodeJS 10.9 or better</p>
","<p>Length of a SHA-512 hash is 64 bytes(512 bits) long which gives you 10<sup>154</sup> combinations of values. So it has a very less (i mean a very very less ) chance of getting same hash. </p>

<p>How much very less it is, think of the weight of the sun from grams (which is weigh million times like the earch). If any other planet weight 10<sup>154</sup> of grams, not even a millions of millions suns combined can be equals to that amount.</p>

<p>So by very less, it means never. Even the bitcoin addresses are using this method as the wallet address. If you by any chance can find that one combination, you will be a billionaire. I promise</p>

<p>Q3 : Similarly, what would happen on a TFS checkout when the content of files in the TFS database become corrupted?</p>
","<p>TFS uses MD5 for its checksum.  When you upload a file as part of a changeset or shelveset, you also send the MD5 that you calculated.  The server will also calculate the MD5 of your upload contents to validate that there was no corruption on the wire.  Similarly, when you perform a Get from the server, it will deliver the MD5 of the content and clients will validate that the checksum matches.</p>

<p>As to your question about corruption, I can only speak hypothetically and only from having worked on TFS.  Obviously if your database is corrupt, all bets are off and we make no guarantees as to anything.</p>

<p>When you say ""a TFS checkout"" (after having discussed ""a git checkout"" above it), I assume you mean ""a TFS working folder mapping"".  The only problem should be when you try to do a get of the corrupted file.  For example, if you had a corrupt <code>$/Foo.cs</code> at changeset 42 and you did a get of changeset 42, then it would fail.  Your local version would not be updated on-disk or on the server and you would not be at version 42 locally.</p>

<p>If, however, there existed a <code>$/Foo.cs</code> at version 43 and it was <em>not</em> corrupt, then you should be able to get changeset 43 without problems.  The server would not examine that previous version.</p>

<p>If you had gotten <code>$/Foo.cs</code> at changeset 42 before the database became corrupt, you should be able to check the file out (in the TFS terminology of ""checkout"", meaning to pend an edit), make changes, then check the file in, but there's certainly no guarantee of this.  You would need to make changes, since if a client tries to produce a changeset or shelveset that includes a file with the MD5 of the current shelveset, the server will instruct the client not to bother sending the changes.</p>

<p>Again, this is all fairly hypothetical.  We didn't exhaustively test data corruption scenarios.  Realistically, if your database is corrupt, all bets are off and you should restore from a backup.</p>

<p>The application in question is not yet live - not far off full completion but still not live, so any change now would be much easier than say 6 months down the line when there's a ridiculous amount of data in the tables.</p>

<p>Would it be worth my while to spend a few hours refactoring the code/database that handles user home addresses and instead of inserting the full one every time, using a hashing algorithm?
This would give us much greater consistency and could obviously be set up in a way that users could share an address hash and so therefore we could even search them by address much easier.</p>

<p>We currently use this method with storing user agents - hash the UA String and store it in its own separate table alongside a Medium Text column for the actual UA string to go, then instead we store the UA Hash in tables that require it (see below), and use SHA1.

","<p>You are correct. Unlike tools like SVN, Git only stores and uses information locally.</p>

<p>If you want to see the very latest activity that may have been performed on a remote repo you can either:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git fetch</code></li>
<li>Remotely browse the repo, if the owner has enabled it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Running <code>git fetch</code> regularly may not be a problem depending on you network etc. However, even with SVN, most people don't care about other commits until they themselves are ready to commit so having your repo updated every 60s is probably overkill.</p>

<p>Git users often commit and push their feature branch and so also don't care about other branches until integration time, which might be later and done in a different repo.</p>

<p>You need to make a choice that makes sense for your workflow and setup. However if you are migrating from a centralised model (such as SVN) don't be afraid to let go and try something more ""Git'sh"" for a time :-)</p>

","<p>To extend someWhereElse's comment.  SHA padding extends the message to the next block boundary.  At the end of the message add a 1 bit (not byte) followed by zero bits until 64 bits from the end of the block.  Use the last 64 bits of the block to hold the length of the message in binary.</p>

<p>Your padded block is made up of:</p>

<pre><code>616263 : ""abc"" - the message text.
8      : ""1000"" - the 1 bit to start the padding, followed by padding zeros.
0...0  : The rest of the padding zero bits.
0000000000000018 : 64 bit message length, 24 bits in this case.

If you use only SSE2 intrinsics, you can not use those mentioned SHA functions, as those were not part of this. You do not have to swap the byte pattern by loading the values into the vectors, this can stay as shown above</p>

","<p>Caveat: Your tags ""<code>linux</code> <code>shell</code>"" do not specify a specific shell. POSIX sh, the standard specifying minimum required behavior for <code>/bin/sh</code>, does not support arrays; you should use a specific shell, such as bash or ksh, which does. To do this, you need to start your script with an appropriate shebang (such as <code>#!/bin/bash</code> instead of <code>#!/bin/sh</code>), and do any manual invocations with the correct shell (so <code>bash -x myscript</code> if you would otherwise use <code>sh -x myscript</code>... though if you've set the shebang correctly and have <code>+x</code> permissions, you can always just <code>./myscript</code>)</p>

<pre><code># this works in bash and ksh, and probably zsh

<p>However, in this particular case, you don't have a reason to use an array at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>The right-hand-side of assignments in with no literal whitespace in their syntax do not need to be quoted.</li>
<li>All expansions (such as <code>$objectFile</code>) <strong>do</strong> need to be quoted, so, <code>""$objectFile""</code>.</li>

<p>A given password is hashed (SHA-1) and then the first 5 characters of the hash is compared against the commonly used ones. This service is exposed via API. This could mean that the first 5 digits of the hash is exposed to the outside world. Isn't that a risk the API users are taking?
What is the probability of finding the possible passwords (eg: rainbow tables) if the first 5 digits of the SHA-1 hashed value is known?</p>

<p>Also if we don't find a matching record - that indicates that the password is not in the list of pwned set. Isn't that a clue that the password is outside this set?</p>
","<p>Everything you've asked (and why the first comment in response to your question isn't relevant) is either answered in the blog post you linked to or in the ensuing discussion in the comments. In short:</p>

<p>The first 5 chars means there are 16^35 different possible suffixes. The total possible values the original password <em>could</em> be is infinite.</p>

<p>You could make an argument that the law of probability dictates the underlying password is more likely to be one already in HIBP and in there with a higher prevalence count, but from the hash prefix alone you have absolutely nothing to verify that assumption.</p>

<p>And even if you <em>could</em> reliably guess the actual password, there's no context of the username it's associated to. Depending on how it's queried, there may also be no context as to which service is checking the API hence no information about where the password is actually used.</p>

"59686117","How to compute hash for structure","<p>I am looking for solution how to compute hash for data structure. Let's assume we have a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct A
{
    float64_t array[4][4];
    float64_t x;
    float64_t y;
    uint8_t validationHash[32]; // here computed hash need to be stored
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also have function <code>Sha256(cont char * input, uint8_t (&amp;output)[32])</code> which as an arguments takes input and output - computed hash. I know that i need to convert each value from structure to const char *. But my question is what to do next, shall I compute a separate hash for each value from array, x and y and add them together or what?</p>

<p>Implementation of Sha256 is the same like here <a href=""http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-sha256-function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-sha256-function</a></p>
","<p>The SHA-256 hash function you linked to, like most cryptographic hash implementations, accepts a byte array as its input. So the very first step is to <em>serialize</em> the data you want to hash.</p>

<p>This isn't as trivial as casting your struct to a byte array. Serialization should be portable between operating systems and hardware. Struct alignment, endianness, etc can vary between system, so it's best to use a <em>serialization library</em>, and leave all those tricky strict aliasing questions to the library authors.</p>

<h3>Best Option: A Serialization Library</h3>

<p>Since you already appear to be using Boost (the <code>float64_t</code> type), you can use the Boost serialization library. First, create a serialization function to instruct Boost how to serialize <code>A</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>namespace boost {
namespace serialization {

template&lt;class Archive&gt;
void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, A &amp; a, const unsigned int version)
{
    ar &amp; a.array;
    ar &amp; a.x;
    ar &amp; a.y;
}

} // namespace serialization
} // namespace boost
</code></pre>

<p>Then, serialize it to an in-memory stream:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>std::ostringstream plaintext_buffer {};
{
    boost::archive::binary_oarchive oa(plaintext_buffer);
    oa &lt;&lt; a;
}
std::string plaintext = plaintext_buffer.str();
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use your SHA-256 hash function. I'll leave that part as an exercise to you. </p>

<ul>
<li>Input: <code>plaintext.data()</code> for data, and <code>plaintext.size()</code> for size</li>
<li>Output: <code>a.validationHash</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Good Option: custom floating point serializer</h3>

<p>According to the comments, you're limited to C++03 (I'll take that as C++98), and can't use any libraries. So first, let's redefine your function using the closest equivalent standard types:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>struct A
{
    double array[4][4];
    double x;
    double y;
    uint8_t validationHash[32]; // here computed hash need to be stored
}
</code></pre>

<p>I slightly adapted this answer: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3418319/serialize-double-and-float-with-c"">Serialize double and float with C</a> , which claims to be a portable IEEE 754 serializer. Cool! I changed the output to a memory buffer, replaced <code>goto</code>, and converted C casts to <code>static_cast</code>.</p>

"59112701","sha512: c program using the openSSL library","<p>I have a program in <code>C</code>, which calculates <code>sha256</code> hash of input file. It is using the <code>openSSL</code> library. Here is the core of the program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;openssl/sha.h&gt;

SHA256_CTX ctx;
unsigned char buffer[512];

SHA256_Init(&amp;ctx);
SHA256_Update(&amp;ctx, buffer, len);
SHA256_Final(buffer, &amp;ctx);

fwrite(&amp;buffer,32,1,stdout);

<p>I need to change it to calculate <code>sha512</code> hash instead.</p>

<p>Can I just (naively) change all the names of the functions from <code>SHA256</code> to <code>SHA512</code>, and then in the last step <code>fwrite</code> 64 bytes, instead of the <code>32</code> bytes ? Is that all, or do I have to make more changes ?</p>
","<p>Yes, this will work.  The <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SHA256_Init.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">man page for the SHA family of functions</a> lists the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> int SHA256_Init(SHA256_CTX *c);
 int SHA256_Update(SHA256_CTX *c, const void *data, size_t len);
 int SHA256_Final(unsigned char *md, SHA256_CTX *c);
 unsigned char *SHA256(const unsigned char *d, size_t n,
                       unsigned char *md);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>...</p>

<pre><code>int SHA512_Init(SHA512_CTX *c);
 int SHA512_Update(SHA512_CTX *c, const void *data, size_t len);
 int SHA512_Final(unsigned char *md, SHA512_CTX *c);
 unsigned char *SHA512(const unsigned char *d, size_t n,
                       unsigned char *md);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>SHA1_Init() initializes a SHA_CTX structure.</p>
  
  <p>SHA1_Update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message
  to be    hashed (len bytes at data).</p>
  
  <p>SHA1_Final() places the message digest in md, which must have space
  for    SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output, and erases the
  SHA_CTX.</p>
  
  <p>The SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 families of functions operate
  in    the same way as for the SHA1 functions. Note that SHA224 and
  SHA256 use    a SHA256_CTX object instead of SHA_CTX. SHA384 and
  SHA512 use    SHA512_CTX.  The buffer md must have space for the
  output from the SHA    variant being used (defined by
  SHA224_DIGEST_LENGTH,    SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH, SHA384_DIGEST_LENGTH
  and SHA512_DIGEST_LENGTH).    Also note that, as for the SHA1()
  function above, the SHA224(),    SHA256(), SHA384() and SHA512()
  functions are not thread safe if md is    NULL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To confirm, let's look at some code segments.  First with SHA256:</p>

<pre><code>SHA256_CTX ctx;
unsigned char buffer[512];

char *str = ""this is a test"";
int len = strlen(str);

strcpy(buffer,str);

SHA256_Init(&amp;ctx);
SHA256_Update(&amp;ctx, buffer, len);
SHA256_Final(buffer, &amp;ctx);

fwrite(&amp;buffer,32,1,stdout);
</code></pre>

<p>When run as:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>./test1 | od -t x1

<p>Outputs:</p>

<p>Which matches the output of:</p>

<p>Now the same code with the changes you suggested:</p>

<pre><code>SHA512_CTX ctx;

<p>The connection to the MySQL server has an encoding ""attached"" to it as well.<br>
So if for example the input from the browser is utf-8 encoded but the MySQL connection uses latin-1 you can easily get differently encoded strings.</p>

"28785419","Google API Key for every possible App","<p>So i'm building an app on appcelerator that uses Google Maps API to show some information on Maps (for android).. I've read all the tutorials, and instructions from Google Developers Console about requesting an API Key. As far as I know, an API Key depends on a SHA1 Fingerprint of the keystore you're using to test your app. That's just fine, I got my API Key and everything works on my Development environment. </p>

<p>The problem is that my boss, at the moment of testing, can't get to see the maps, I think cause his ""dev_keystore"" SHA1 defers from mine, so there must be an Authentication problem. (that i know right)</p>

<p>But what bothers me the most is that there is another app that he (or someone on his team) builded, I get that app to my development environment, runs it with his API Key, and it works... even using my dev_keystore i guess...</p>

<p>So my question is: is it possible to create an API Key that works on every environment, regarthless the key_store SHA1 and stuffs ? I mean, how in hell is that API Key configured that works fine on my computer, as well as in his.?</p>
","<p>Ok, i figured out what's going on.. The default keystore that comes with titanium studio is the same for every installment of it. So the other developers might have (and the did) created an API Key for those apps with the default keystore, and that's why it is working on every environment. </p>

<p>I bet that when my boss tries to publish that app, it will not work at all. he'll need to create a more app-related API Key, but that's another story to tell.</p>

<p>Is there any secure improvement if I hash (SHA-256) IV value before concat to cipher byte?</p>
","<p>SHA-256 is <em>injective</em>. You give it the same input, it will give you the same output. It is not <em>surjective</em>, however. If <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> both hash to <i>h</i>, you cannot conclude that <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, even if you know that |<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>| = |<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>| (both messages are of the same length).</p>

<p>Therefore, applying SHA-256 (or any deterministic function) cannot increase the entropy of your data. At best, it won't decrease it. In other words: If your data is 16 purely random bytes, it won't be “more than purely random” after you hash it. And if your data was not purely random to begin with, then hashing it won't help making it random. You have to use a better entropy source in the first place.</p>

<p>Another problem that you didn't mention is that you currently have 16 random bytes but if you put them into your SHA-256 hash function, you'll get 32 bytes out. Which ones are you going to use? If you only use every second byte – due to injectivity – you won't get all possible bit patterns even if your input was perfectly random and the hash function was flawless. (If you did, then this would – by the pidgin hole principle – mean that the other half of the bytes would always be a function of the bytes you did chose. Only a really crappy hash function, which SHA-256 of course is not, would have such property.) If you try to be clever and combine the bytes in some “smart” way, chances are that you'll make things even worse.</p>

<p>So the short answer is: just don't do it. Generate as many random bytes as you need using the strongest non-deterministic entropy source you have available and use them directly.</p>

","<p>It's not common practice to encrypt a salted hash. It may slightly increase security but realistically it's not worth it, since you'd have to manage the key in some way, complicating the whole process. If I were you, using a salted hash with a secure hashing algorithm will do fine.</p>

","<p>If the hash was produced by a ""good"" algorithm, than it doesn't make any sense to cipher it, since you would be essentially ciphering something that in theory only the rightful user can generate.</p>

<p>After seeing this kind of thing over and over again, my question becomes how do I figure out the encoding of the Base64-looking ""password"" strings?  If these strings were actual (MD5/SHA1-looking) hashes, it seems like one could try and recover the plaintext by checking rainbow tables, but I don't see anyway to get from the point of ""I have a random non-hex string"" to ""Here's how I know (x) is the hash from which that random string was derived.""</p>

<p>How does one identify ""password"" strings from POST entries (like the above) as a given encoding, and then convert them back to actual password hashes?</p>
","<p>They probably are not hashes. They are random strings.</p>

<p>If they were Base64 encoded, they would have a different length (it would be divisible by 4).</p>

<p>So probably these are attempts to login into accounts the spammers created earlier (or believe they created earlier)?</p>

<p>HTTP forms usually submit passwords in <em>plaintext</em>, which is why you should use https.</p>

<p>How is it possible to create a hash over 78 times smaller than the raw string?</p>
","<p>SHA-256 is non-reversable so it can be shorter. But the real answer is google SHA-256 (or another cryptographic hash) and examine the code. Here is a real-world example of a hash. A bottle club has over 1000 members but has only 100 bins to store member's bottles. It just uses the last 2 digits of the membership ID number for the bin number, a simple hash. That reduces the 1000+ bottle to 100 pigeonholes.</p>

"59173967","Understanding RS256 and SHA256 during JWT Token creation","<p>I am creating a JWT Token using a private key in PHP. For this I am using the OpenSSL library.
Before anything I will share my code :</p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong> </p>

<pre><code>    $header = [
        self::ALG =&gt; self::RS256,
        self::TYP =&gt; self::JWT
    ];
    $payload = [
        ""iss"" =&gt; $this-&gt;getClientID(),
        ""iat"" =&gt; time(),
        ""exp"" =&gt; time()+999
    ];
    $header = base64_encode(json_encode($header));
    $payload = base64_encode(json_encode($payload));
    $token = $header.""."".$payload;
    $pkey = openssl_pkey_get_private($this-&gt;getPrivateKey(), $this-&gt;getPassPhrase());
    openssl_sign($token, $signature, $pkey, 'sha256'); //no algorithm specifically for rs256
    $sign = base64_encode($signature);
    return $token.""."".$sign;
</code></pre>

<p>So, this JWT Token will be used for authentication in a server which I am trying to hit. But I get the response from the external server as a <code>Bad Request</code>, problem happening in my JWT token creation.</p>

<p>With same credentials, I tried in javascript using the library <code>jsrsasign</code> and it then gives me the correct response. </p>

<p><strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong></p>

<pre><code>// Header
var oHeader = { alg: 'RS256', typ: 'JWT' };
// Payload
var oPayload = {};
var tNow = rs.KJUR.jws.IntDate.get('now');
var tEnd = tNow + 1000;
oPayload.iss = ""playground.pizza"";
oPayload.iat = tNow;
oPayload.exp = tEnd;
var sHeader = JSON.stringify(oHeader);
var sPayload = JSON.stringify(oPayload);
var pkey = ""my private key"" //I replaced all the new line with \n here and had in one line
var prvKey = rs.KEYUTIL.getKey(pkey, ""my_pass_phrase"");
var sJWT = rs.KJUR.jws.JWS.sign(""RS256"", sHeader, sPayload, prvKey);
ultraSecureToken = sJWT;
</code></pre>

<p>One difference which I can clearly see is that for the <code>signature generation function</code> in the php end I am passing <code>sha256</code> as the algorithm and in the JavaScript <code>RS256</code> is passed.</p>

<p>I read about how sha256 is just a hashing algorithm and RS256 is used for encoding, but in all the libraries I found in php, they were internally passing <code>sha256</code> only in the <code>openssl_sign</code> function. And <code>openssl_sign</code> doesn't have RS256 as an algorithm parameter.</p>

<p>So, firstly is there anywhere where I went wrong.</p>

<p>Secondly, is there a way we can generate a signature using RS256 in php. </p>

<p>PS : I am looking for solution in php.</p>

<li><p><a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-sign.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openssl_sign</code></a> also uses RSA with RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 padding and therefore creates the <em>same</em> signature with SHA256, assuming the same key and the same data to be signed are applied.</p></li>

<p>I'm using esp-8266 Arduino. 
I have a program that makes an API call every few seconds to a certain website from my Arduino. Because this website is using HTTPS I'm using the WiFiClientSecureBearSSL.h library. </p>

<p>In order to use this library, you must provide the fingerprint SHA-1, the problem is that I need every time the website changes their fingerprint to manually change it in my code. </p>

<p>Is there any way to get the fingerprint automatically?</p>

<p>Thanks </p>
","<p>I have a similar problem. I don't want update over OTA my ESP everytime a SSL certificate changes.</p>

<p>But you are not alone and a lot of users want a solution. See <a href=""https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=8744"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=8744</a></p>

<p>Some times, you can find the certificate or fingerprint directly on the webpage, like on <a href=""https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/</a> 
Some times, you have to write a script to retrieve the certificate or fingerprint.</p>

<p>As written in the forum, my solution is not good (security reasons), but works:<br>
1. Set an alternative webserver with http, when the certificate fails<br>
2. Call a request to this server to ask a new certificate/fingerprint<br>
3. Save the new fingerprint in your ESP</p>

<p>I made a simple page to retrieve the SSL from other webservers over PHP:
<a href=""https://projects.petrucci.ch/esp32/?page=ssl.php&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://projects.petrucci.ch/esp32/?page=ssl.php&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stackoverflow.com</a></p>

<p>There is also a PHP code, so you can implement it on your webpage if you have a server with PHP. Just use this: <code>openssl_x509_fingerprint($cert);</code></p>

<p>Hope to find a better solution one day (or maybe the ESP will automatically get the fingerprint in future, like every browser).</p>

<p>drastically cuts down on the number of guesses while (I think?) still covering the whole space. Still getting some duplicates and still no luck finding the match though..</p>
","<p>Your code, if not very efficient, looks fine except for one thing:</p>

<pre><code>hexOut = hex(int(b2,2))
</code></pre>

<p>as the output of <code>hex</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hex(int('01110110000101',2))
'0x1d85'
</code></pre>

<p>starts with <code>'Ox'</code>, which shouldn't be part of the key. So, you should be fine by removing these two characters.</p>

<p>For the number of possible keys to try, you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 with no bit flipped</li>
<li>128 with 1 bit flipped</li>
<li>128*127/2 = 8128 with 2 bits flipped (128 ways to choose the first one, 127 ways to choose the second, and each pair will appear twice)</li>
<li>128*127*126/6 = 341376 with 3 bits flipped (each triplet appears 6 times). This is the number of combinations of 128 bits taken 3 at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the total is 1 + 128 + 8128 + 341376 = 349633 possibilities.</p>

<p>Your code tests each of them many times. You could avoid a the useless repetitions by looping like this (for 3 bits):</p>

<pre><code>for x in range (0, 128):
    for y in range(x+1, 128):
        for z in range(y+1, 128):
            .....
</code></pre>

<p>You could adapt your trick of starting at -2 with:</p>

<pre><code>for x in range (-2, 128):
    for y in range(x+1, 128):
        for z in range(y+1, 128):
            .... same code you used ...
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You could also generate the combinations with <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">itertools.combinations</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import combinations
for x, y, z in combinations(range(128), 3):  # for 3 bits
    ......
</code></pre>

<p>but you'd need a bit more work to manage the cases with 0, 1, 2 and 3 flipped bits in this case.</p>

","<p>It looks like your <code>convert</code> stream grows continuously for each iteration, appending the new value each time. The easiest fix is to move the declaration of <code>stringstream convert;</code> inside the for loop to create a new one each time. </p>

<p>Further optimisations are certainly possible as it's not efficient to convert numbers to strings the way you are doing it for the large number of iterations in the main loop.</p>

  <p>SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and
  64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and
  additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually
  identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384

</blockquote>

<p>""Could be considered secure"" isn't asking much. I consider it secure against unauthorized login, as long as an attacker doesn't have access to the device, the network, or the database. A straightforward system that transmits and stores the password in cleartext would also be secure in that kind of situation. It would make more sense to ask with a specific security goal and threat model in mind.</p>

<p>Here are a few key problems that this design:</p>

<ol>
<li>If an attacker can get the hashes from the database, they can log in by computing <code>sha256([hash] + unixTime)</code> without knowing the password.</li>
<li>An attacker that controls the network can intercept a <code>sha256([hash] + unixTime), unixTime</code> pair and use it verbatim. SSL would prevent such an attacker from obtaining those values.</li>
<li>If an attacker can get the hashes from the database, they can quickly try hashing passwords and see which users' hashes match. Salted hashes would prevent this.</li>

","<p>It sounds like in addition to saying you don't want to use a self signed cert that you're also oppossed to using https even if it was a certificate issued from a trusted certificate authority; is that so and if so why? Having your password in plaintext even once is a significant vulnerability; that plaintext password is free game to anyone running packet capture software on machines that your network traffic traverses, not to mention that if you've chosen the wrong http method then those passwords will definitely end up sitting in the logs of any proxies along the way. </p>

<p>I'd also suggest that at the least you store your passwords properly salted. Not doing so results in a number of security weaknesses if your database is retrieved by a malicious party; for example pre generated rainbow table attacks would be feasible as well as an attacker being able to easily identify which users have identical passwords thanks to the hashes matching.

<p>I assume you mean that you're hashing data. SHA is a family of hashing algorithms, not encryption algorithms.</p>

<p>The primary way you would distinguish is their lengths. SHA-1 is 160 bits (20 bytes). SHA-2 comes in several forms, from 224 to 512 bits (28-64 bytes).

"42810344","Distinguish SHA-1 and SHA-2","<p>We got a programm which encrypts data and need to know wether it's using SHA-1 or SHA-2. Unfortunately the only hint is a table with hash values.
Can someone please tell me how I can distinguish the two encryption types and tell which one is used here?</p>
","<p>You probably mean hashing not encryption. encryption is reversible, hashing is not, encryption is like random permutation as opposed to hash which tries to be like a random function. 
SHA-1 is 160bit (20 bytes) long, while SHA-2 is a family of hash functions 224-512 bits long (28-32 bytes). 
Note you may have hex-encoding or base64 encoding which will give you 4 or 6 bits per encoded character. 
In some cases (for example password hashing) it is customary to prefix hashes with information on how they were created and you would see hash strings start with some special prefix such as $1$ which tells you what you are looking at. </p>

<p>If you do not have an extra prefix and have the data truncated to the same length, and you do not know anything about the input before the hashing I do not believe you can discern between the two by any practical means. An ability to tell the difference between SHA-1 and truncated SHA-2 would mean at least one of them can be separated from random data which we require secure cryptographic functions to be undistingishable from. 
I am unaware of a practical distinguishing attack. </p>

<p>Regardless of computational complexity you can't tell where a single hash came from with high probability since most hashes have a pre-image also from the other function.</p>

"57574344","Python RSA: Will ""crypto.sign"" sign a String with lowercase hex digest","<p>I used the python lib <code>OpenSSL.crypto</code> to load a <code>.p12</code> file, and then I used the <code>hashlib.sha256</code> to generate a digest of my data. The question is that I cannot get the ""signature"" I want. Is it because the python lib, <code>crypto.sign(pkey, data, digest)</code> used the lowercase <code>a-z</code> rather than the uppercase <code>A-Z</code> in the <code>hexdigest</code>? The code is shown here.</p>

<p>The signature is different from the one generated by another method of <code>JAVA-RSASHA256</code>.
Java used the digest below: The final String is with upper format <code>A-F</code>.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.security.MessageDigest;
char hexDigits[] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};
try {
    byte[] btInput = content.getBytes(""UTF-8"");
    MessageDigest mdInst = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    mdInst.update(btInput);
    byte[] md = mdInst.digest();
    int j = md.length;
    char str[] = new char[j * 2];
    int k = 0;

        byte byte0 = md[i];
        str[k++] = hexDigits[byte0 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4 &amp; 0xf];
        str[k++] = hexDigits[byte0 &amp; 0xf];
    }
    return new String(str);
} catch(Exception e) {

<p>Will <code>crypto.sign(pkey, data, digest)</code> of Python uses the lowercase digest to generate a signature? So the signature is different from that of java because java takes the uppercase?

<p>My question is whether modern cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA256, are periodic in this sense?

","<p>Absolutely not. If that was the case it would be trivial to find a collision. The strength of a cryptographic hash function is defined by how hard it is to find Hash(a) == Hash(b).

<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SHA2</a> is a <em>family</em> of hash functions. In practice, ""SHA2"" usually means SHA2-256 or occasionally SHA2-512. My guess is that your external API is probably using the more common SHA2-256.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9043/what-is-the-difference-between-pkcs5-padding-and-pkcs7-padding"">This answer</a> on crypto.stackexchange explains that PKCS#5 is essentially a subset of PKCS#7. I'd be willing to bet that the API you're calling made the same mistake described in that answer and should really be calling it <code>PKCS7Padding</code>. Your code is fine!</p></li>
<li><p>The IV isn't the same thing as the secret key (or just the ""key"" for AES). The IV <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/8041580/3191599"">should be random</a> for every encryption run. You aren't supposed to derive it from the input plaintext or the input key. Fortunately, <code>AesCryptoServiceProvider.GenerateIV()</code> will generate one for you. It's up to you to <strong>prepend</strong> it to your output stream, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes()</code> to get the plaintext and secret key bytes makes sense to me. I don't think that's causing a problem.</p></li>

<p>Stealing from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/56488564/3191599"">this excellent answer</a> to a similar question (go give them a vote!), I'd try code like this:</p>

    }

    if (key == null || key.Length != AesKeySize)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException($""{nameof(key)} must be length of {AesKeySize}"");
    }

    using (var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider
    {
        Key = key,
        Mode = CipherMode.CBC,
        Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7
    })
    {
        aes.GenerateIV();
        var iv = aes.IV;
        using (var encrypter = aes.CreateEncryptor(aes.Key, iv))
        using (var cipherStream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            using (var tCryptoStream = new CryptoStream(cipherStream, encrypter, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
            using (var tBinaryWriter = new BinaryWriter(tCryptoStream))
            {
                // prepend IV to data
                cipherStream.Write(iv);
                tBinaryWriter.Write(data);
                tCryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
            }
            var cipherBytes = cipherStream.ToArray();

            return cipherBytes;
        }
    }

","<p>I finally managed to get it to work.</p>

<p>A big part of the problem was that API documentation did not specify that hashedString has to
be composed of <strong>hexadecimal</strong> characters.
It also didn't say that authKey should be a <strong>base64</strong> string.
I don't know if this is so standard that it goes without saying but knowing this could have 
saved me hours of agony. I was converting the hashed/encrypted bytes back to ASCII
and much of it was unprintable characters that were causing the server to send back
a HTTP response with status 400 BAD_REQUEST.</p>

<p>It also required hashedString to be hashed using SHA256 but the documentation does not mention it.
Thanks to @<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3191599/nate-barbettini"">Nate Barbettini</a>'s answer for steering me in the right direction on this.</p>

<p>Also, it appears that AES ECB mode does <strong>not require</strong> an initialisation vector unlike other
modes like CBC so I didn't specify an IV.</p>

<p>For padding I specified PKCS7 (again thanks to @<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3191599/nate-barbettini"">Nate Barbettini</a> for that).</p>

","<p>You can convert a <code>String</code> to a byte array simply by using the <code>String.getBytes()</code> method. Note that this returns the bytes that compose the string representation of the hash value, not the numeric value of the hash.</p>

<p>Instead, assuming your hash values are hexadecimal (base 16) encoded strings then you can use Google's <code>guava</code> library. It has a <code>Hashing</code> class with hashing utilities. It has a <code>HashCode</code> class that stores the hash value, e.g. in byte array (<code>BytesHashCode</code>). This class has a <code>fromString(string)</code> method to create a <code>HashCode</code> instance from which you can get the byte array / long / int representation of the actual value.

<li>SHA-2-256 / SHA-3-256: 68,719,476,736</li>

<li>SHA-2-512 / SHA-3-512: 137,438,953,472</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the .NET implementation (in Rfc2898DeriveBytes) is an iterative stream it could be polled for 32GB via a (long) series of calls.  Most platforms expose PBKDF2 as a one-shot, so you'd need to give them a memory range of 32GB (or more) to identify if they had an error that far out.  So even if most platforms get the sign bit wrong... it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>PBKDF2 is a KDF (key derivation function), so used for deriving keys.  AES-256 is 32 bytes, or 48 if you use the same PBKDF2 to generate an IV (which you really shouldn't).  Generating a private key for the ECC curve with a <a href=""http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=27"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">34,093 digit prime</a> is (if I did my math right) 14,157 bytes.

"50632444","Is there a universal function F that F(sha(a),sha(b)) = sha(ab)","<p>I am faced with a need to send my data in parts, and at the same time I am expected to provide sha256 for my WHOLE data.</p>

<p>Something like this <code>cat large file | chunker | receiver</code>
where receiver is an application that is expected to receive the data, possibly in chunks having in the header sha256 of the payload, and then following payload. After collecting all chunks, it is supposed to store the whole transmitted data, and the sha256 of all data (particular sha256 will be used only to rehash and confirm integrity of the data.)</p>

<p>Of course, the simplest thing would be if the receiver generated sha256 from whole the streamed data, but I was wondering if there is a simpler way by collecting all hashes of all chunks, and combine them to generate one final hash, which would be the same as the hash calculated from all the data.</p>

<p>In other words - and I copy this from the title - I wonder if there is a function F that would receive a list of hashes of chunks of data, and then generated final hash that would be equal to the hash generated on all the data.</p>

<p>And again, in other words, having this formula:
F(sha256(data[0]), sha256(data[1]), ... sha256(data[N])) = sha256(data[0..N])</p>

<p>What would be the function F?
Would it be a universal function or there is no such thing for the way hashing is calculated?</p>

<p>I suspect there is no such function or this is too complicated question to answer.</p>
","<p>AFAIK there are still no known collisions for SHA-256 but I bet that once some is found, i.e. someone finds two messages <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> such that <code>SHA-256(m1) = SHA-256(m2)</code>, then for almost any prefix <code>a</code> hashes <code>SHA-256(a || m1)</code> and <code>SHA-256(a || m2)</code> will be different i.e. the function you ask is actually not a function (has different outputs for the same inputs). Or to put it otherwise SHA-2 is susceptible to length extension attacks but AFAIK not to prefixing attacks. Still even if this actually a function, it is not enough for you for such a function to exist, you also want it to be fast. And I believe there is no such fast to compute function. </p>

<p>On the other hand SHA-256 works by splitting the original message into 512-bit chunks and processing them using a well defined process (which is based on the state from all the previous chunks) so theoretically you can modify some implementation of <code>SHA-256</code> to compute two hashes at the same time (by applying the same logic to different initial states):</p>

<ol>
<li>Hash of your application-defined chunk (using standard initial state)</li>
<li>Hash of all chunks up to this point (using the state passed from the previous output of the same step as the initial state).</li>
</ol>

<p>This probably will be slightly faster than doing those things independently but I don't know whether it will be so much faster to justify such a custom implementation.</p>

"25713416","Keeping user's API secret of SHA secured in db","<p>I have a mobile app communicating with server over HTTPS. Upon successful signup I return the app a unique API secret to be saved locally on the device. This API secret is used for all private method calls made to server following successful signup from this user.</p>

<p>In the header of each request made to server I put:</p>

<pre><code>""key"":  username
""sign"": (SHA256 of post_parameters using API secret)
</code></pre>

<p>Server takes the post_parameters and SHA256 using the username's unique API secret found in db. If result matches ""sign"" then access is granted.</p>

<p>My question is this:</p>

<p>How do I keep each user's unique API secret safe on server db? If someone gets access to usernames and their API secrets, he has full control of user's account.</p>
","<p>You need to store the hash of the secret in the database, but require the user to provide the secret. That way, if the database leaks, then an attacker has the hash, but doesn't have the secret itself. When the user logs on, hash the secret that the user provides, and check whether it matches the stored hash.</p>

<p>To make it more secure yet, you could consider using <em>salt</em>: store a random value (in plaintext) in the database for each user as well, and then when you calculate the hash, you hash the salt plus the secret. So you store</p>

<pre><code>salt_value  H(salt_value . secret)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>.</code> denotes concatenation. This is more secure because if the attacker has a hash dictionary (i.e., has worked out the hash of millions of likely passwords) then he still can't break the hash: his dictionary won't have factored every possible salt value into it.</p>

<p>For ultra-modern security, you can also hash repeatedly. Rather than storing</p>

<pre><code>H(salt_value . secret)
</code></pre>

<p>you store</p>

<pre><code>H(H(H(H(...H(salt_value . secret) ...))))
</code></pre>

<p>i.e., you hash it a large number of times (say, 10,000 times). When the user logs on, hash the salt and secret repeatedly, and then compare the final result with the stored value. This is even more secure because it takes a lot longer to mount a brute force attack: the attacker will have to calculate 10,000 hashes to try a single guess at a secret.</p>

"49021878","Access to byte stream while deserializing JSON","<p>I've been trying to find a mechanism to provide access to the raw json while deserialising a field in json.net. My class is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Message {
    public Signature Signature { get; set; }
    public string Payload { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This currently gets serialised to:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""$type"": ""SignedMessage"",
  ""Signature"": {
    // Signature details here
  },
  ""Payload"": ""{\""$type\"": \""Foo\"", \""value\"":\""Bar\"" }""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The payload itself is json that has currently must be produced in a prior serialisation step, and conversely has to be deserialised in a following seperate step, this also means the json produced isn't particularly clean since it gets encapsulated within the outer wrapper. The current arrangement allows me to hash the Payload so i can either produce a signature or validate an existing one.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to make Message generic:</p>

<pre><code>public class Message&lt;T&gt; {
    public Signature Signature { get; set; }
    public &lt;T&gt; Payload { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which I can certainly do but then Payload is automatically deserialized (which is good) and I miss my opportunity to calculate a hash for signature verification (which is bad). It leaves me with two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add conditions to T so it implements some interface aiding hash calculation.</li>
<li>While deserializing perform a hash on the raw json of Payload.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first option sounded OK until i realized that i'd have to the method on EVERY class being serialized and then it sounded terrible.</p>

<p>The deserialisation calculation sounds a lot nicer and makes things more flexible for how and where that hash gets calculated.</p>

<p>The problem is thus far I can't seem to find anything allowing me access to the raw json within the json.net conversion process. Does json.net even feature that capability?</p>

<p>For the most part I'd like to minimize the custom code required for deserialisation, though I have written a few minimal effort converters to make the json neater.</p>

","<p>From a security perspective MD-5 is utterly broken. </p>

<p>SHA-1 is considered suspicious, and avoided for most uses if at all possible. For new projects: don't use it at all.</p>

<p>SHA-2 (aka SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.) is still widely used for fast hashes.</p>

<p>SHA-3 is the future since 2012, nothing is stopping you from using it already. I see little reason not to use it for new projects.</p>

<p>What's the problem with older ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their resistance to finding collisions is below par: This is an attacker creating 2 contents that have the same hash. These are constructed at the same time. This problem is there for MD5 and SHA-1, and it's BAD, but requires the attacker creating both versions (and then they can do a switch at any time they want undetected).</li>
<li>Their resistance to length extension attacks is relatively weak. This is especially true for MD5, but SHA-1 and even SHA-2 to some degree suffer from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is it not a problem: to ensure your disk has not produced an error: and hash will do, even a simple CRC32 will work wonders (and I'd recommend the simpler CRC check), or a RAID array, as these can fix errors, not just detect them.</p>

<p>Use both ?
Well if you have to find a collision on one hash and have that same set of plaintexts also produce a collision on another hash, is probably more difficult. This approach has been used in the past, The original PGP did something like it. If I'm not mistaken it had a number of things it calculated, one of them simply the length (which would prevent the extension attack above).</p>

<p>So yes, it likely adds something, but the way md5 and SHA-1 and SHA-2 work internally is quite similar, and that's the worrisome part: they are too much alike to be sure just how much it adds against a highly sophisticated attacker (think the level of the NSA and their counterparts).  </p>

<p>So why not use one of the more modern versions of SHA-2, or even better SHA-3 ? They've no known weaknesses and have been peer-reviewed heavily. As such for any commercial level use, they should be more than enough.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I found that ord values generated by both packH in java and pack(""H*"", $str) in php results are the same, but saltBin string looks diffrent. I think that there is a problem, beacause hashSHA256 in java and hashSHA256(""sha256"", $str) in php gives the same result. How to solve this??</p>

SHA256_PassHash(HASH_CODE, password, 64);
</code></pre>

<p>First, param is the hash code, second is the var will be encrypted, third is the base64</p>

<p>I made the encrypt on NodeJS, but I have no control on hash code, so the systems don't make the same hash, how to select the code on the register on NodeJS so the system communicates with others?</p>

<pre><code>const code = 'WEASDSAEWEWAEAWEAWEWA';
const normal = 'anne';
const crypto = require('crypto');
const encrypted = crypto
     .createHash('sha256')
     .update(normal)
     .digest('base64');
console.log(encrypted);

","<p>By looking at the PHP code you've provided.</p>

<pre><code>hash(""sha256"", $_POST['psw'] . $HASH_SENHA)

<p>It's hashing the string concatenation of <code>$_POST['psw']</code> and <code>$HASH_SENHA</code></p>

<p>So, the equivalent code in Node.js should look like below</p>

<p><strong>Node.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');
const code = 'WEASDSAEWEWAEAWEAWEWA';
const input = 'password 123';

const encrypted = crypto

<p>I am pretty sure that I am not doing anything wrong when it comes to the padding as well as the creation of the opad and ipad tables. Perhaps my string to int conversions are off. Perhaps its a weird quirk with Lua 5.3 that I don't know about. I don't know what I am missing here. It could be very obvious, but I am not seeing it at the moment. Thanks in advance for your assistance.</p>

<p>I should add that this implementation is needed for a lua sandbox in which I cannot use other libraries.</p>

"57859621","Secure Communication Between Tomcat Servers","<p>Note: this question was sort of asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46668529/secure-api-communication-between-two-backend-servers"">here</a>, but not answered.</p>

<p>I need to communicate securely between two Tomcat servers running in two different environments. I have control of both servers.</p>

<p>I would like to do this through a simple REST call from Server-B to Server-A.</p>

<p>On the server I am communicating to, Server-A, I can easily set up HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. If I import this certificate into the Java Keystore on Server-B, I can make a trusted HTTPS Rest call from my Java code on Server-B.</p>

<p>Good instructions for doing this can be found here:
<a href=""https://blog.10pines.com/2017/09/25/how-to-communicate-via-https-between-two-tomcat-servers-using-a-self-signed-certificate/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://blog.10pines.com/2017/09/25/how-to-communicate-via-https-between-two-tomcat-servers-using-a-self-signed-certificate/</a> </p>

<p>I would also like to add a confirmation that the Rest call to Server-A is certainly coming from Server-B and the message has integrity.</p>

<p>My plan is to generate a self-signed certificate on Server-B and  import this certificate into the Java Keystore on Server-A. Then for any REST call from Server-B I will first generate an SHA-512 hash of the message and sign the hash with the private key associated with the Server-B certificate. When Server-A receives the message, the SHA-512 hash will be recalculated and checked for accuracy of the hash (no message tampering). I will then check the signature of the Hash against the public key of the certificate from Server-B.</p>

<p>For a little bit of extra paranoia I may encrypt the REST message with the public key of the certificate from Server-A; for short messages this should be fine (no need for Symmetric encryption).</p>

<p>Does this seem like a good plan? Does Tomcat have a simpler mechanism for doing this?</p>

<p>The Java Messaging API seems a little ""heavy"" for this use case.</p>

<p>After the collection period is over, i would like to be able to run statics on the answers. But it is very important that the users answers can not be traced back to a specific user/ip.</p>

<p>The reason that i would still like to store ip, regardless of my desire for the users to be anonymously, is that i would like to exclude entries where the user (with malicious intent or by accident), take the same test multiple times in a short span.</p>

<p>I have ruled out using encryptions, as it is, to my limited knowledge, not possible to compare a large set of encrypted strings like that.</p>

<p>My currently self proposed method is then to store: The user agent, a session identifier and a hashed ip address.</p>

<p>Regarding to the hashing method, i am thinking to use sha512 where the ip is prepended with a 16 character long salt (same salt for all entries). </p>

<p>I know that when hashing simple and common strings, that sha512 and other hashing methods can be broken with tools like: <a href=""http://md5decrypt.net/en/Sha512/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://md5decrypt.net/en/Sha512/</a> and good old brute forcing.</p>

<p>My idea to then guarantee user anonymity, is that after the collection period is over, i will delete the salt. Making it (to my knowledge) near impossible to brute force the hash. Even if a malicious party got hand on my source code.</p>

<p>I know it seems like a low tech solution, and that party of the security is based on my own action of actually deleting, where i en theory could forget or change my mind. But it is the only solution i could come up with.</p>

<p>Security is very important for me, as I cannot accept modified data, so I am thinking about adding a message diggest (signature) to check integrity... but is it needed having it over HTTPS?</p>
","<p>HTTPS already has sufficient signing to prevent accidental modifications.</p>

<p>A straight message digest with no secrets provides no protection against deliberate tampering. An active man-in-the-middle attacker could easily replace the digest with their own value, recalculated to match any alterations they made.</p>

<p>For a signature to have value against tampering it must have been created using a secret key on the sender, and the signature must be verifiable on the receiver, which means you must have a way to pre-exchange keys between parties before use.</p>

<p>For the case where the client is a general purpose web browser there is no channel to do that, other than transferring it over HTTPS at which point that interaction is just as vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and you gain nothing. This is a bootstrap problem.</p>

<p>For the case where you have a custom application client you have distributed to your users through a channel more trusted than HTTPS (eg you physically handing them copies of the code), then yes, adding a server-to-client signature based on public key crypto could theoretically provide some value. But rolling your own crypto is prone to implementation errors and best avoided.</p>

<p>What's the attack you're trying to counter here, that HTTPS together with the commercial CA infrastructure doesn't address well enough?</p>

<p>If your concern is that the PKI of commercial CAs is historically prone to occasional fraudulently-issued certificates and state-level spying, then a much simpler way of defending against that would be to run your own private CA for application use, and have your client accept only certs issued by that CA (and not the certificates built into the system like Verisign et al).</p>

<p>Whether through running a CA, or ad hoc signature checking, running your own PKI securely and effectively is a bunch of ongoing overhead. Be sure the public commercial PKI really can't meet your needs before going that route.</p>

<li>I was reading the user guide for <code>FIPS object module</code> which told that the last step in building a program with <code>FIPS capable openssl</code> was to use <code>fipsld</code> to link my program with <code>openssl</code> rather than <code>gcc/ld</code> as it computes <code>sha1sum</code> of <code>fipscansiter.o</code> using <code>fipsprelim.c</code>.</li>

"40706506","Connection between RC4 removal and SHA 1 removal","<p>Is there any connection between the removal of RC4 stream cipher and SHA 1 certificate removal?
Meaning - did the removal of one force the other one to be removed or it just happened to be that they both have been removed at the same time?</p>
","<p>TL;DR: There is no such connection. The purpose of each of these algorithms is different, and they have no such effect on each other.</p>

<p><strong>SHA1</strong> is a cryptographic hash function, its purpose is to create a one way hash of the data in the certificate. There are several properties of cryptographic hash functions, the ones being important in this case are second pre-image resistance (given <code>data1</code>, it should be very difficult to find a different <code>data2</code> such that <code>h(data1)=h(data2)</code>) and collision resistance (it should be very difficult to find <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code> such that <code>h(data1)=h(data2)</code>).</p>

<p>If these requirements are not met in a hash function used for hashing certificates, one would be able to come up with a different certificate that has the same hash. That would be <em>bad</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with SHA1 is that it is easier to find a collision that it was supposed to be. To shed some ligh on the degree of the problem, it should be around 2^80 hashing operations (expected value) for a 160 bit hash function to find a collision. As opposed to that, for SHA1 it is around 2^63 according to an attack published in 2005. That is still a <em>huge</em> number and still practically infeasible, but people thought there may be a feasible attack in a few years, so it seemed better to just retire SHA1 now when people still have time to change certificates to a better hash function while SHA1 is still pratically secure.</p>

<p><strong>RC4</strong> is a stream cipher, it's input is a data stream and a key, the output is an encrypted stream. There have been known weaknesses for a long time, but those did not make it possible to actually break RC4 as it is used in SSL/TLS (attacks were not computationally feasible). Then in 2015, multiple researchers presented different attacks against RC4 (the Bar-mitzvah attack, the NOMORE attack, the improved Royal Holloway attack) that made it much more feasible to break RC4 in TLS in real life. Actually, most probably there are now organizations that can crack TLS if RC4 is used as the stream cipher, so it was removed based on the recommendation of IETF.</p>

"54655696","Create SHA hash and compare it when the source has moved location","<p>I've created a simple C# program that can hash a file (I'm focusing on images, as opposed to PDF's, text etc) that displays the hash only on the command line. I will create a function to output a file (unsure what type?) so that this can be referenced later.</p>

<p>The idea is that an image will travel from one location to another, and once it reaches the second destination it will be checked by the hashing program once more, locating the hash file associated with it, comparing it, and then producing the result (i.e. it is identical or not). The code I have is not very relevant, hence why I've not posted it - I'm mainly just looking for tips/hints or any documentation that might be of use here!</p>

"16698025","Getting back to an erroneous git reset","<p>Say I'm working on a project and I'm making various commits as I go along</p>

<p>A - B - C - D - E</p>

<p>And I realise that I made a mistake and need to do <code>git reset</code> to go back to version C.</p>

<p>So I then carry on making commits like this: C - D2 - E2 - F2 - G2 etc.</p>

<p>Where D2 is different to D, E2 is different to E etc.</p>

<p>I then realise that I was right in the beginning, and I need to get back to E.</p>

<p>As long as I have kept a note of the SHA of version E, is this possible by doing <code>git reset hjsdkgjdfg</code> where hjsdkgjdfg is the hash of E? I've heard git 'cleans up' (deletes) loose ends every now and then - would D and E be classed as 'loose ends'? Does it depend on the type of reset I have done: soft, mixed, hard?</p>

<p>Bearing in mind I'm a beginner, is this the correct sort of workflow? Or is this a terrible way of working?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Yes, if you remember the hash you can get back to it.  You might want to use <code>git checkout</code> or <code>git branch</code> rather than <code>git reset</code>, though.  You're right that git cleans up occasionally - you'll see it when it happens, because you'll get some messages about ""garbage collecting.""</p>

<p>To be safe, you can keep a branch pointing at your old commit, and then you'll be able to access it symbolically rather than by remembering the hash.</p>

<p>If you need to find an old hash, but you don't remember it, <code>git reflog</code> can help you find it.  You can also do tricks like:</p>

<pre><code> git checkout @{yesterday.at.3.pm}
</code></pre>

<p>If you know roughly the time you want to go back to.</p>

Are there any ready solutions? Or maybe there's another way to use SHA-1 as PRNG in python? The quistion is asked because the code of SHA-1 PRNG in NIST tests confused me a bit.(the code is from NIST tests, it's in sts-2.1.2/sts-2.1.2/src/generators.c in the end). To be honest,I expected that SHA-1 PRNG works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>we have some starting value(let it be x), after that we do something like <code>r=sha1(x)</code></li>
<li>now we have r as a new member of the pseudo-random sequence</li>
<li>and to have another member we do <code>r=sha1(r)</code>
But with that NIST code I really don't understand how to implement SHA-1 PRNG on python. </li>

<p>I solved: what I've done is just going to the ""Gradle"" menu on the right and delete all ""Run configuration"" voices that Android Studio created after I run the command.</p>
","<p>Sounds like you have the signingReport selected as the current 'run configuration'.  If you look up in the top menu bar of Android studio, you'll see a lot of little icons on the right side.  If you go to the third icon from the left side of the group, you will see a little down-pointing arrow.  I'm guessing it will also have the text signingReport.  Click the down arrow and select the 'app' run configuration.  Then, hitting play should start the App and prompt for a device.</p>

","<p>SHA-1 is a one way hash function... though it should not be used in most of the cases but in your case since you are using it for WeChat you have no other option but to use it , unless WeChat modifies there implementation.</p>

<p>Also to answer your other question , which is when HTTPS encrypts your request , so HTTPS is a protocol which insures that the data in motion is secured and encrypted.</p>

<p>When a browser attempts to access a website that is secured by SSL, the browser and the web server establish an SSL connection using a process called an “SSL Handshake” (see diagram below). Note that the SSL Handshake is invisible to the user and happens instantaneously.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySfNV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySfNV.png"" alt=""SSL Handshake""></a></p>

<p>Essentially, three keys are used to set up the SSL connection: the public, private, and session keys. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Because encrypting and decrypting with private and public key takes a lot of processing power, they are only used during the SSL Handshake to create a symmetric session key. After the secure connection is made, <strong>the session key is used to encrypt all transmitted data.</strong></p>

The source files are being stored on a local server on the network that all build machines can access. Currently, our Windows build machine is assembling the filepaths and Sha hashes for both Windows and OSX builds due to it being much faster than our OSX build machine, and then passes off the JSON information to the OSX build machine to complete the process.</p>

Does anyone know what's happening here or what commands are messing up? We are only seeing this on OSX, whereas the exact same code is being run on windows with no issue. </p>

<p>You don't define what that means:</p>

<p>Should that hash change if you add some RAM, or some SD card, or some USB device, in your system?</p>

<p>Should that hash change if you replace the hardware by some identical one (e.g. one RaspberryPi burned, and you replace it with another one with the <em>same</em> SD card)? Or by a similar hardware faking to be the original one?</p>

<p>Should that hash change if you (or some adversary) make a minor upgrade of your OS kernel, or if you add some additional package or program in your system?</p>

<p>Should that hash change if you make some minor configuration (e.g. change some configuration file under <code>/etc/</code>, assuming some Linux-like system)?</p>

<p>Notice that on many systems, you can change the MAC address by some software tricks (I don't know if that applies to your RaspberryPi).</p>

<p>So I think that there is <strong>no failproof solution</strong> to your question.</p>

<p>(in other words, with enough efforts and skills, you can always fake some existing system; you might want that to be difficult enough to be not worth the effort, but that makes a different question; is your typical adversary as powerful as the NSA, or do you just care about a teenager hacker?).</p>

<p>BTW <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> (see <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proc(5)</a>) could change with a kernel upgrade, and can be faked quite simply (to stay the same) by some kernel patch even after a hardware change.</p>

In particular, <code>sha1sum</code> usually defaults to text mode for applications.</p>

<p>What is the difference between reading in text mode and binary mode, when checking checksums using <code>sha1sum</code>?</p>

<pre><code>~/Downloads$ sha1sum --help
Usage: sha1sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print or check SHA1 (160-bit) checksums.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -b, --binary         read in binary mode
  -c, --check          read SHA1 sums from the FILEs and check them
      --tag            create a BSD-style checksum
  -t, --text           read in text mode (default)
  -z, --zero           end each output line with NUL, not newline,
                       and disable file name escaping

The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
      --ignore-missing  don't fail or report status for missing files
      --quiet          don't print OK for each successfully verified file
      --status         don't output anything, status code shows success
      --strict         exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
  -w, --warn           warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-1.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a
line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary,
' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

","<p>All hashes obviously collide eventually, for input of length greater than the size of the digest. Moreover, few attempt to guarantee lack-of-collisions even for input that is close to the size of the digest</p>

<p>How <em>often</em> that happens - under typical, pedantic, or similar inputs - is a result of the quality of the hash.</p>

<p>(for example, a CRC is guaranteed to have distinct hashes for input that changes by a single bit - but secure hashes can't offer that)</p>

"53375105","Tell from PGP signature which algorithms served in its creation","<p>I am dealing with a Debian repository that apparently contains an <code>InRelease</code> file that may have been signed in a way that is <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/387053/debian-9-apt-and-gpg-error-inrelease-the-following-signatures-were-inva"">no longer appropriate</a>. The symptom is that clients receive the warning <code>The repository '... InRelease is not signed</code> when they run <code>apt-get update</code>.</p>

<p><code>InRelease</code> contains sections starting with <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----</code> and <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----</code>, so it is signed, and I've already adjusted my PGP <code>personal-digest-preferences</code> and <code>personal-cipher-preferences</code> settings to exclude SHA-1 from use. But something is still lacking.</p>

<p>My question is this: When I inspect the actual signature (the ASCII armor between <code>----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----</code> and <code>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</code>) is there a way to tell which algorithms served in its creation, and specifically whether SHA-1 served in its creation? I guess the answer is no, but I'd like to hear an expert's opinion.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> The first line after <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----</code> reads <code>Hash: SHA256</code> so that looks good (since I've chosen <code>SHA256</code> first in the preferences settings), but the problem still persists.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I've now excluded SHA-1 also from indices by calling <code>apt-ftparchive packages</code> and <code>apt-ftparchive release</code> (for creating files <code>Packages</code> and <code>Releases</code> respectively) with additional parameters <code>--no-sha1</code>, but the problem still persists.</p>
","<p>So now it looks as if the signature was already valid (after removing SHA-1 digests as described), but the signing key was not yet known. </p>

<p>So adding the signing key to clients with <code>add-key add key.pub</code> made the problem disappear.</p>

<p>I haven't found any concrete solution to figure out changed images based on the updated timestamp in windows. Therefore, I decided the following approach: </p>

<p>1.) Generate checksums for all the files and store them somewhere. Maybe database or filesystem.</p>

<p>2.) Every time I send files to another system, compare the checksums and send only the files which have different checksums.</p>

<p>In order to test the above, I tried to generate a checksum (SHA and MD5) for two different images, and the checksum was the same.</p>

<p>Following is the sample code: </p>

<pre><code>package com.test;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils;

public class TestHash {
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

            String checksumSHA256 = DigestUtils.sha256Hex(new FileInputStream(""monkey_11.jpg""));
            System.out.println(""checksumSHA256 : "" + checksumSHA256);

            String checksumMD5 = DigestUtils.md5Hex(new FileInputStream(""monkey_11.jpg""));
            System.out.println(""checksumMD5 : "" + checksumMD5);


            String checksumSHA256_1 = DigestUtils.sha256Hex(new FileInputStream(""monkey.jpg""));

            System.out.println(""checksumMD5 : "" + checksumMD5_1);

        }

- I tried extracting the HASH value of the images and compared them. This works well when two images are exactly same(means no changes over the years).
